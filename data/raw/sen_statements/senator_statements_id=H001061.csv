https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-its-time-for-biden-administration-to-end-covid-19-restrictions-along-us-northern-border,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after Canada announced that all COVID-19 testing, quarantine and vaccination restrictions along the northern border would end as of October 1. “As Canada has ended their COVID-19 restrictions along the U.S. border, it’s now time for the Biden administration to follow suit. North Dakota and other northern border states rely greatly on trade and travel with our northern neighbors for economic opportunity, and Canadians should not be denied entrance into the U.S. solely due to their vaccination status. At the same time, we will continue pressing CBP to resume pre-pandemic hours at North Dakota’s ports of entry.” Hoeven has repeatedly urged the Biden administration to reopen the U.S. border with Canada for trade and travel.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-helps-introduce-legislation-to-stop-the-ban-of-traditional-ammo-and-tackle-on-public-lands,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven this week joined Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in introducing the Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2022. This legislation would prohibit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from banning the use of traditional lead ammunition or tackle on public lands. This bill comes one week after the USFWS published a rule that prohibited the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle at certain wildlife refuges.“The federal government should not be implementing a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to hunting and fishing,” said Hoeven. “These activities are a treasured pastime in North Dakota and it’s important that federal overreach doesn’t hinder a sportsmen’s ability to participate.”In addition to Hoeven and Daines, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Dan Sullivan (R-Ala.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.). Earlier this year, Hoeven joined a Daines-led effort in urging USFWS Director Martha Williams not to cave in to activists’ calls to restrict the use of lead ammo and tackle on public lands.-###- "
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-working-to-improve-rancher-access-to-fair-and-competitive-markets-strengthen-livestock-disaster-programs,"BISMARCK, N.D. – At the North Dakota Stockmen’s Association annual meeting today, Senator John Hoeven discussed his efforts as the Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee and a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee to:“Due to the hard work of U.S. livestock producers, Americans have access to the highest-quality beef in the world, and as such, they deserve the opportunity to compete in a fair market,” said Hoeven. “That’s exactly what we’re working to accomplish by establishing a cattle contract library and advancing other initiatives to create more transparent and competitive cattle markets. At the same time, our ranchers have faced significant challenges, including from last year’s historic drought and severe spring weather, and we continue working to ensure they have the tools they need to recover.”Improving Competition in Cattle MarketsIn addition to advancing the cattle contract library, Hoeven worked to provide an additional $2 million in FY22 for AMS to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act and has helped introduce legislation to:Strengthening Livestock Disaster ProgramsFurther, Hoeven is working to ensure livestock disaster programs effectively help ranchers to recover from losses due to natural disasters. After hearing producers’ concerns at a roundtable discussion he held earlier this year, Hoeven began working with the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to update LIP national payment rates to reflect actual market rates.The senator raised the issue to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and FSA Administrator Zach Ducheneaux, pressing them to adjust the program’s rates and ensure it adequately covers losses due to eligible diseases. As a result, FSA updated LIP payment rates for calves weighing less than 250 pounds, which are now valued the same as non-adult cattle weighing between 250 and 399 pounds and increased payment rates for calves under 400 pounds.Hoeven also introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Tester last year to better align coverage between the LFP and ELAP. The bill would permanently increase producer assistance under LFP to more accurately compensate them for feed costs, while specifying that transportation costs for feed and water are covered losses under ELAP. -###- "
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-army-corps-awards-contract-for-pipestem-dam-safety-project-construction,"JAMESTOWN, N.D. – Senator John Hoeven today announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a $131.5 million contract to Barnard Construction Company for the construction of the Pipestem Dam safety modification project, utilizing funding that Hoeven worked to secure for the project in the Corp’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 work plan. Through his role on the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee, Hoeven worked with the Corps to ensure the project continued to be funded in the annual work plan and to keep it on schedule. The senator also advanced this priority with Army Corps Chief Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon during his confirmation process in 2020. The contract comes in addition to the $40 million award that Hoeven secured for the project last year.  “Finalizing this contract is another important step forward for this vital project at Pipestem Dam,” said Hoeven. “We worked to fully fund the remainder of the safety modification project to keep this effort on schedule, helping to prevent further erosion, maintaining the integrity of the dam and protecting the Jamestown region against the threat of flooding.” -###-"

This legislation would preserve the readiness of the Armed Forces by limiting separations based on COVID–19 vaccination status and continuing pay and benefits for members while religious and health accommodations are pending. As the military faces recruiting and retention deficits, it is not in the interest of national security to separate otherwise ready servicemembers solely for vaccine refusal.“We need to be working to strengthen our Armed Forces and support the brave men and women in uniform, especially with recruitment numbers down,” said Hoeven. “Continuing to put punitive COVID-19 mandates in place is the wrong approach. It’s long past time that the Biden administration ends their COVID mandates and we’ll continue working to block federal overreach like this that hinders our active duty, Guard and Reserve members.”In additional to Hoeven and Blackburn, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.). Click here for the full bill text. -###- Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/nd-delegation-dod-announces-funding-to-prevent-road-washouts-near-minot-air-force-base,"WASHINGTON – Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Congressman Kelly Armstrong today announced that the Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has awarded $2.9 million to the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT). This funding was made available through the Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot Program and will be used for road maintenance at the crossroad of US Highway 2 and US Highway 52, commonly referred to as Brooks Junction, west of Minot. In a letter to DoD, the delegation urged for the approval of NDDOT’s request, outlining the need to reduce risk of washouts along the high traffic route to support the operations of the 91st Missile Wing at the Minot Air Force Base (MAFB) as well as the local agriculture and energy sector in North Dakota. “Both highways have an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of approximately 5,500 vehicles and are used not only by the 91st Missile Wing, but also the agriculture and energy sectors in the state,” the delegation wrote. “In order to ensure the resiliency of this vital network, three structures will be replaced, including a mission-essential structure used by the 91st Missile Wing for convoy operations that include a large number of security forces and maintenance vehicles. The proposed project would provide improved reliability and safety, while supporting our nation’s defense as well as domestic food and energy security.” -###-  "
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-solution-to-high-energy-costs-is-clear-biden-administration-needs-to-take-handcuffs-off-us-oil-and-gas-producers,"WASHINGTON – During remarks delivered on the Senate floor this week, Senator John Hoeven outlined how the Biden administration’s policies are undermining U.S. energy security and causing persistent record-high inflation for American consumers and businesses. The senator called on the administration to empower greater domestic energy production, utilizing all of the nation’s abundant energy resources, including coal, oil and natural gas.“North Dakotans are paying 60 percent more for gasoline since January 2021, and diesel remains nearly $5.00 per gallon,” said Hoeven. “Our friends and allies in Europe are facing an even worse energy supply crisis, and unless the Biden administration changes its approach, American families and businesses will continue to face these inflationary pressures. Fortunately, the solution is clear – more energy supply means consumers pay less.“Recent analysis by The Wall Street Journal shows that the Biden administration leased only 130,000 acres for new oil and gas production in its first 19 months. For comparison, President Reagan leased 47.6 million acres during the same time period. We need to take the handcuffs off U.S. producers if we are going to produce more energy here at home, and nobody produces energy better, more cost-effectively, more dependably and with better environmental stewardship than America. New energy leases are needed to grow oil production and supply for the long-term, otherwise production will continue to fall and that means higher energy costs for consumers.“The Biden administration’s policies are undermining our energy security, and because the cost of energy is built in to our entire economy, inflation has been driven to record highs. Despite these challenges, President Biden and Congressional Democrats doubled down by passing their partisan tax and spend bill that will make it more expensive to produce energy in the United States.“Instead of higher taxes and fees, more mandates, and less energy development, we need to take the handcuffs off our domestic energy producers to lower energy costs and help reduce the burden of inflation, which harms every American, but particularly those low income Americans, who are struggling with the higher cost of everything from putting food on the table, to gas at the pump, to anything and everything they buy.”-###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/nd-delegation-cbp-agrees-to-expand-operating-hours-at-maida-northgate-and-sherwood-ports-of-entry-in-north-dakota,"WASHINGTON – Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and Congressman Kelly Armstrong today announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agreed to temporarily expand operating hours at Maida, Northgate and Sherwood ports of entry (POE) in North Dakota. Pending agreement from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the hours of operation at these three POEs will be 9am to 7pm, 10 hours per day. In July, the delegation raised this priority to CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus, stressing the need toensure that northern POEs are open and accessible for lawful trade and travel. CBP’s full response can be read here.“The limited hours of operation at our northern ports of entry have created real challenges for North Dakota’s residents and our economy,” said Senator Hoeven, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee. “That’s why we’ve been working to get CBP to extend the operating hours at our state’s POEs, including through our letter to CBP Commissioner Magnus and in calls I held with CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner Flores. Today’s announcement is an important step. However, more needs to be done, and we will continue to press CBP and the CBSA to return to pre-pandemic levels of operation at our northern ports of entry.""  “While it’s encouraging to see the temporary expansion of hours at the Maida, Northgate, and Sherwood ports of entry, Customs and Border Protection’s work is far from over. Temporary won’t cut it and our neighbors to the north, Canada, must do the same. North Dakotans’ ability to conduct cross-border activity remains unnecessarily restricted as CBP refuses to return to pre-pandemic hours at our ports of entry. We will continue to push for the restoration of full operation hours at all ports of entry in North Dakota to accommodate lawful travel and trade with Canada, our close ally and largest trading partner. At a time when the U.S. economy is suffering from record high inflation, it is critical we remove obstacles to the legitimate flow of goods and services and alleviate the mounting strain on the supply chain. The President declared the pandemic over the other day, it’s past time to return to pre-pandemic hours at the northern border ports of entry in North Dakota,” said Senator Cramer.  “It is important to many North Dakotans and our state’s economy that ports of entry with Canada are accessible. It is positive that CBP has reevaluated and will extend operating hours at these three crossings,” said Congressman Armstrong. “We need to build on this development by expanding access at additional ports of entry and encouraging CBSA to match them. We will continue working to expand trade and cooperation with our northern ally.”In CBP’s response, the agency did not commit to opening other POEs in North Dakota. -###-"

This funding was made available under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funded by the annual appropriations process and will be used to support the required sewer and earthwork necessary for the extension and reconstruction of Taxiway B and Runway 9L/27R. The Grand Forks International Airport is currently in the beginning stages of a multi-year airport expansion and development project that will ultimately improve safety and increase capacity to support flight training activity by the University of North Dakota (UND), as well as commercial air service. Last month, the airport temporarily closed to commercial air traffic in order to complete reconstruction of the intersection of two of the runways.    “With over 365,000 flight operations per year, Grand Forks International Airport is one of the top 25 busiest airports in the country. We’ve worked to support this project in order to ensure that UND has the airport capacity to continue to train the next generation of airline pilots, to support the continued economic development of the Grand Forks region, and to enhance the safety of the traveling public,” said Hoeven. -###- "

Hoeven, who serves as a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, held the meeting today with Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member John Boozman (R-Ark.) to allow North Dakota producers, commodity groups and other agri-businesses to provide input as work begins on the next farm bill. The senator invited Boozman to the state to help ensure the unique needs and priorities of the region’s agriculture industry are addressed.“Our farmers and ranchers do a tremendous job producing the highest quality, lowest cost food supply in the world, but the work they do and the challenges they face vary widely across our country,” said Senator Hoeven. “It’s essential that we continue to provide a safety net that can adequately meet our producers’ needs, no matter where they live and work. This is a special opportunity for North Dakota’s ag producers, farm groups and agri-businesses to provide direct input on the next farm bill. I appreciate my good friend and colleague Ranking Member Boozman for joining us, and I look forward to our continued work together to ensure our nation maintains a strong farm policy.”“I am grateful for Senator Hoeven’s partnership and the invitation to join him for this very constructive discussion. Our states may be leading producers of vastly different commodities, but our producers still face similar challenges such as disasters, regulatory hurdles and policy decisions that directly impact their families and communities.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-presses-administration-to-end-head-start-covid-mandates,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven this week sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra pressing the administration to rescind its one-size-fits-all mask and COVID-19 vaccine mandates on Head Start programs. Despite a court injunction, HHS still has in place an interim final rule (IFR) requiring Head Start staff and volunteers to be vaccinated and all staff, volunteers and children age two and older to wear masks, including when they are outside. “While there remains a preliminary injunction against the IFR in multiple states – including North Dakota – uncertainty remains for many Head Start providers, parents, and children. Therefore, I once again urge you to immediately rescind the IFR so that families can have access to the important early childhood development and child care services offered through Head Start,” wrote Hoeven. The senator outlined staffing challenges facing Head Start providers due to the mandates and the uncertainty caused by the one-size-fits-all rule. Today’s letter continues Hoeven’s efforts to end overreaching COVID mandates. Earlier this year, Hoeven joined Senator John Thune in introducing a resolution to nullify HHS’s vaccine and mask mandates for Head Start programs.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-helps-introduce-bill-to-remove-burdensome-regulations-on-trucking-industry,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven today joined Senator Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) in introducing the Trucking Regulations Unduly Constricting Known Service-providers (TRUCKS) Act. At a time when the American Trucking Association estimates a nationwide trucker shortage of 80,000 drivers, this legislation would remove burdensome government regulations, which are impacting the agricultural industry, school districts and trucking companies in rural America.“At a time when we already have a shortage of drivers and continued supply chain constraints, the FMCSA’s new training requirements impose higher costs and discourage new drivers from entering the workforce,” said Hoeven. “Our legislation provides important regulatory relief and flexibility by allowing exemptions for agriculture, small businesses and state and local governments. This will help ensure farmers, ranchers and other small businesses, as well as school districts and other government entities have access to the reliable and affordable transportation services they need while ensuring safety on our roads.”“At a time when our nation is in a recession and faced with worker shortages and supply chain issues, American businesses should not have to battle the heavy hand of government,” said Rounds. “We should be working on policies to help our producers and consumers, not hurt them. This legislation eases the burden on small trucking companies, agricultural producers, school districts and local units of government. It also gives power back to the states so they can decide their own rules of the road.”Earlier this year, a final rule went into effect creating a new requirement for Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT), adding a burdensome requirement for drivers to obtain their Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). This requirement is costly and time consuming, as ELDT training classes range from $450 to $8,500, depending on the trainer, and can take anywhere from three days to 20 days to complete. The TRUCKS Act would exempt employees of agriculture-related industries, school districts and local units of governments (including county, municipal and tribal), from the new ELDT requirements to obtain their CDL. For agriculture-related industries, this legislation would allow states to waive all ELDT requirements for Class A CDLs. Currently, states can waive ELDT requirements for Class B CDLs, but they cannot waive them for Class A CDLs or most endorsements.In addition to Hoeven and Rounds, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).

The senator pushed back on the administration’s decision to double-down on failed policies and its refusal to allow needed energy development on federal lands, which is worsening the issues facing American consumers, farmers, ranchers and many others.“Inflation has now exceeded 8% for six straight months. This persistent high inflation is causing price increases for American families at the grocery store, at the gas pump, and for basic housing needs, leaving many Americans struggling to make ends meet,” said Hoeven. “Rather than getting government out of the way, increasing domestic energy production, securing our border, and taking meaningful action to reduce inflation, the Biden administration is instead doubling down on its failed economic policies.“Last month, as follow-up to their massive $2 trillion spending package from March 2021 that fueled the inflationary fire we are now dealing with, Democrats jammed through yet another tax and spend package on a party-line vote that imposes new energy taxes and Green New Deal-style subsidies that will only worsen our current energy crisis and weaken our nation’s economic and national security.“Ironically, the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act”, does nothing to help reduce inflation. Analysis by economists at Penn Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the Federal Reserve, Moody’s Analytics, the Congressional Budget Office, and others all agree that this bill will do nothing to help reduce inflation.“Meanwhile, the cost of food at the grocery store has increased 13.5 percent over the last 12 months – the largest 12-month increase since March 1979. Yet, the Biden administration has done nothing to help alleviate these inflationary price increases on Americans.”-###- "

Under the letters of intent, Taiwan will purchase U.S. soybeans, corn and wheat, including products from North Dakota. “Taiwan has been an important and dependable trading partner with North Dakota for years,” said Hoeven. “When I was Governor, I sent a delegation to Taiwan to expand export opportunities for North Dakota producers and businesses, and we’re pleased to see that this important trading relationship continues to flourish today. Our producers are the best in the world, and continue to grow food, fuel and fiber to feed the world. Today’s commitment by Taiwan to purchase $3.2 billion worth of U.S. agriculture products over the next two years is welcome news to our farmers and ranchers.”As governor, Hoeven worked to expand export options and sent a trade delegation to Taiwan in 2004. As U.S. Senator, he has continued his efforts to grow this important trade relationship and provide access to a valuable foreign market for U.S. producers. In 2019, the senator also joined U.S. and Taiwanese agriculture representatives to sign letters of intent for Taiwan to purchase more than $3 billion in agriculture products.   -###- Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

The medical center, which opened in 2017, brought together the previous hospital, clinic and long-term care providers into one facility, providing more streamlined and effective care to the region’s residents. The $30.5 million facility was supported by a direct loan for $11 million and a guaranteed loan of $10.3 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Community Facilities Program, which Hoeven works to support as the lead Republican on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee.“With a modern facility and state-of-the-art equipment, the Sakakawea Medical Center is bringing improved access and more efficient health care to Hazen and the surrounding communities,” said Hoeven. “Moreover, by leveraging telehealth technologies, we can give providers even greater reach, delivering more convenient and cost-effective care to people, regardless of their ZIP code.

The senator outlined the important role of the NDVC in helping ensure the state’s veterans receive the recognition and honor they have earned, and discussed efforts to enhance the cemetery since he first came into office as governor in 2000, eight years after the cemetery was established. Among other efforts, this includes:“North Dakota has a rich tradition of military service, and laying our veterans to rest with honor is one important way that we can ensure their courage and sacrifices are properly remembered,” said Hoeven. “That’s why we’ve worked hard to enhance this cemetery and have supported the NDNG in making this the finest state veterans cemetery in the nation. VA grants have played an important part in these efforts, and the legislation we passed earlier this year ensures the NDVC can continue to access these important funds while allowing our Guard and Reserve members, who protect this nation right alongside their active duty counterparts, to be interred at state veterans cemeteries.”  Burial Equity for Guard and Reserves Act  The bipartisan, bicameral Burial Equity for Guard and Reserves Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, makes members of the National Guard and Reserve Component, as well as certain family members, eligible for burial in state veterans cemeteries without those cemeteries losing access to federal grants. Among other efforts, Hoeven worked to secure support for the bill while hosting Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs (USMA) Matthew Quinn in North Dakota last year. Quinn again joined Hoeven at the NDVC today to mark the cemetery’s anniversary.Previously, if a cemetery received federal grant funding, then only certain servicemembers who met national eligibility standards were allowed to be buried there. This requirement led to uncertainty regarding whether the NDVC was eligible for certain grants. The legislation introduced by Hoeven, Shaheen, Cramer and Hassan addressed this issue by prohibiting the VA from conditioning grants on a cemetery’s compliance with existing eligibility criteria for burial. -###-"

The transfer was possible due to an agreement that Hoeven secured with Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Brown. As a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, Hoeven:Currently, the Department of Defense (DoD) uses an aging fleet of ships deployed across a Pacific Ocean corridor to test hypersonic missiles, which is expensive, takes weeks to set up and signals the testing schedule to America’s adversaries. Sky Range would replace the ships with modified Global Hawks that could deploy quickly and increase testing capacity through the creation of additional testing corridors in the Pacific and elsewhere. Standing up SDA’s LEO Mission Last year, Hoeven, working with the SDA Director and Senator Kevin Cramer, secured Air Force approval to stand-up SDA’s new LEO satellite mission at Grand Forks. As a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, Hoeven then worked to secure $18 million in Fiscal Year 2022 funding to establish SDA’s space networking centers. Over time, the mission could include not only operating SDA satellites, but also linking them with UAS, which would complement Grand Forks’ role in Air Force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.  Prior to this, Hoeven hosted SDA Director Derek Tournear in North Dakota to outline efforts to establish the new center and announce the new laser communications project, which SDA is pursuing in conjunction with General Atomics.

After hearing concerns from North Dakota farmers, Hoeven has been working with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials, including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Under Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation Robert Bonnie and FSA Administrator Zach Ducheneaux to resolve the issue, which had improperly subjected some producers to lower payment limits, preventing them from fully recovering their eligible losses.In addition, USDA will begin sending applications to producers that were not included in ERP phase one. This includes those who had their 2020 prevent plant claims inadvertently excluded from their original pre-filled ERP applications, which Hoeven successfully worked to correct.“This appeals process is an important correction to the row crop disaster aid that we secured for our producers, helping to resolve issues with FSA’s AGI calculations and ensuring farmers can more effectively recover from last year’s historic drought,” said Hoeven “Today’s announcement builds on the prevent plant fix we secured last month, for which USDA will start sending out corrected applications next week, along with applications for other producers not included in the first phase of ERP.” Producers should contact their FSA county office to learn more about the appeals process, including eligibility and documentation requirements.Improving ERP’s Implementation Hoeven repeatedly raised both the AGI and prevent plant issues with USDA officials, having:Securing Disaster AssistanceIn September, Hoeven secured $10 billion in agriculture disaster aid, including $750 million for livestock producers.

Today’s circuit court decision just makes matters worse. We should instead empower our energy producers to utilize all of our vast energy resources, including our oil, gas and coal reserves, and to do so with the best environmental stewardship in the world.

In particular, Hoeven discussed proposed changes to the USFS rangeland directives.Last year, the senator led the North Dakota delegation in pressing the USFS Chief to extend the public comment period for the proposed directives, stressing the broad presence of federal land in North Dakota and its impact on the state’s ranchers. In response, the agency agreed to extend the comment deadline, giving livestock producers and grazing groups the necessary time to review the changes and provide thorough feedback to the agency. Hoeven continues working to ensure the USFS works with local stakeholders and that any new rangeland directives are made in consultation with grazers. To this end, the senator also secured a commitment from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment Homer Wilkes, who oversees the USFS, to visit North Dakota and to work collaboratively with grazers and local stakeholders.“We’re working to ensure the USFS maintains fair and equitable treatment for our ranchers, because they know this land best and have long been good stewards of our natural resources,” said Hoeven. “That means consulting with grazers, taking their input and relying on their expertise for any changes to the rangeland practices. The vast amount of federal land in North Dakota presents real challenges for many industries in our state, including our ranchers, and it is essential that the USFS and other federal agencies act as good neighbors.”North Dakota is home to 1.1 million acres of national grasslands, representing nearly one third of total grassland acres managed by the Forest Service. The rangeland management directives are the primary source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees regarding the rangeland management program. -###-"

The senator stressed that the Democrats’ $740 billion spending bill and the Biden administration’s burdensome regulatory approach delay and increase costs for energy development, which leads to higher prices and rising inflation throughout the economy. Accordingly, Hoeven is: “The Biden administration and Congressional Democrats continue to push our nation down the wrong path, imposing burdensome regulations and taxes that increase costs for our energy and agriculture producers, while further increasing federal spending. This just causes more inflation and even higher prices for consumers,” said Hoeven. “We need to take the handcuffs off our energy producers and support our farmers and ranchers to bring down energy and food prices.

The majority of the livestock assistance has now been provided, but we need the row crop aid to get to our farmers as well. We continue pushing USDA to release the program details, which they’ve said should happen later this month, and because the assistance relies on existing crop insurance data, the payments are expected to go out quickly after that,” said Hoeven. “At the same time, we’ve had blizzards and calf mortality this spring, and the FY22 LIP payment rates don’t reflect the true cost of those livestock. We’re asking that USDA work to adjust those rates and to ensure all eligible diseases that result from these severe storms are covered.”Securing Livestock & Row Crop Disaster AidLast September, Hoeven worked as the lead Republican on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee to provide $10 billion in agriculture disaster assistance, which includes $750 million for livestock producers and $9.25 billion to aid row crop producers who suffered losses due to droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other qualifying disasters in calendar years 2020 and 2021. USDA began sending phase-one ELRP assistance to ranchers last month, with payments set at 75% of producers’ 2021 Livestock Forage Program (LFP) payment.

The senator visited a family-owned ranch near Max to learn firsthand about the damages and met with ranchers, local leaders and a representative from McLean Electric Cooperative to discuss available assistance. This includes the following programs that Hoeven worked to secure and strengthen, which are both helping address the impacts of last year’s historic drought and will also provide a needed lifeline to producers impacted by recent storms: In addition, Hoeven is coordinating with the state on the disaster response and is working to get assistance for downed power lines. This includes securing assistance through a federal disaster declaration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would help cover repair costs and mitigate the impacts of future disasters.“These recent spring storms are a real challenge for our ranchers, hitting them right during calving season and threatening the health of their livestock,” said Hoeven. “Not only did this disaster follow a historic drought, but the storms brought widespread power outages, making this situation even more challenging and creating a hazardous situation for people both on and off the ranch. This meeting is about ensuring ranchers can access the assistance that we’ve worked to make available, including the disaster aid we passed last year, as well as the Livestock Indemnity Program. We appreciate this opportunity to hear firsthand from ranchers, local leaders and representatives from McLean Electric Cooperative as we work to help communities recover.”Securing ELRPHoeven worked to secure $750 million for livestock producers as part of $10 billion in disaster aid, which also includes $9.25 billion in disaster funding to aid row crop producers who suffered losses due to droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other qualifying disasters in calendar years 2020 and 2021. USDA will provide that assistance using existing crop insurance data in a two-phase approach as well, beginning this spring.To be eligible for ELRP, livestock producers must have suffered grazing losses in a county rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a D2 (severe drought) for eight consecutive weeks or a D3 (extreme drought) or higher level of drought intensity during the 2021 calendar year, and have applied and been approved for 2021 LFP.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-urging-army-corps-to-address-boat-ramp-maintenance-at-lake-sakakawea-lake-oahe-asap,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Committee, this week met with Col. Mark Himes, Commander of the Army Corps’ Omaha District, to advance repair efforts for boat ramps and recreation areas around Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe, which are currently impacted by drought conditions that make lake access difficult. The senator is urging the Army Corps to ensure maintenance of the lakes’ facilities is completed as soon as possible to improve access to the lakes for the spring and summer. To this end, Hoeven has worked with Himes and the Corps to:“Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe are premiere recreation sites, and important to the economies and quality of life of communities throughout the region. That’s why we continue working with the Army Corps to address drought-related maintenance needs, including for boat ramps, to ensure people can access the lakes this spring and summer,” said Hoeven. “This was another productive conversation with Col. Himes, and I appreciate him working with us to get a drought coordinator in place, ensure a streamlined permitting process for these maintenance projects and find funding to get the work done as soon as possible.”The meeting builds on Hoeven previous efforts with Col. Himesand Col. Geoffrey Van Epps, Commander of the Northwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to address needed repairs. The senator also recently sent a letter to Army Corps Chief Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon outlining the maintenance needs in the region.  Prior to this, Hoeven worked to include report language in annual appropriations legislation directing the Corps to work with local stakeholders on a long-term sustainable plan to restore and maintain recreational facilities near Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe. Stakeholders can obtain Missouri River updates from the Water Management Division at https://www.nwd-mr.usace.army.mil/rcc/index.html. -###- "
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-heinrich-introduce-chronic-washing-disease-research-and-management-act,"WASHINGTON – Senators John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) this week introduced bipartisan legislation to support both the research and management of chronic wasting disease (CWD). The bill would authorize $70 million per year, split evenly between these dual purposes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would administer the funds through cooperative agreements with state and tribal wildlife agencies and agriculture departments. The legislation also includes an authorization for USDA and state and tribal agencies to develop educational materials to inform the public on CWD and directs USDA to review its herd certification program (HCP) within 18 months. “CWD is a growing threat to both wildlife and livestock, impacting sportsmen, ranchers and the local ecology of regions across the U.S.,” said Hoeven, Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee and a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “Our legislation would empower state and tribal governments to better manage and prevent outbreaks of this deadly disease, while also advancing new methods for detecting CWD and limiting its spread.”“Chronic wasting disease is a direct threat to the wildlife that New Mexicans cherish, particularly deer and elk,” said Heinrich. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation so that we can invest in much-needed research and mitigation. Together we can protect these species and our unique way of life.”Specifically, the legislation authorizes funds for the following priorities:ResearchManagementIn addition to Hoeven and Heinrich, the legislation is cosponsored by Senators Steve Daines, Jon Tester, Roger Marshall, Amy Klobuchar, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Tina Smith and Cory Booker.“By threatening Montana wildlife and ecosystems, chronic wasting disease also threatens our sportsmen legacy and outdoor way of life,” Daines said.“My bipartisan bill will support Montana’s ongoing efforts to research, manage, and contain the spread of chronic wasting disease among wildlife populations.”“Chronic Wasting Disease is a serious threat to the health of deer, elk and other animals—some of which are important food resources in communities,” Smith said. “This bill would help support states and tribes research, address, and prevent spread of the disease. This bill has broad support, and hopefully can start addressing the threats that CWD plays to our wild and farmed deer.”“The spread of chronic wasting disease, which has a presence in Mississippi, is a major cause for concern.  We must dedicate more resources to understanding all we can about the cause, spread, management and control of this always-fatal disease,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I am pleased to support Senator Hoeven’s legislation to give the USDA more resources to focus on this problem.”“In order to protect Montana’s outdoor recreation economy and pristine wildlife, we have to get a handle on Chronic Wasting Disease,” said Tester. “With cases rising in Montana, it’s critical that the state and Tribes have the necessary resources to research and manage CWD so that we can keep our state safe for years to come.” “Chronic Wasting Disease poses a serious threat to our state’s deer and elk populations and we need a stronger understanding of how to address and prevent this fatal illness. This bipartisan legislation will help bolster research into surveillance, prevention and management practices, ensuring that we have the most effective tools in place to combat this highly contagious disease,” said Klobuchar.The CWD Research and Management Act is supported by the following organizations: the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF), Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP), National Wildlife Federation (NWF), Boone & Crockett, National Deer Association (NDA), North American Deer Farmers Association (NADeFA), Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation (RMEF) and the Mule Deer Foundation.

This action comes as the Biden administration has plans to institute a final rule redefining a “firearm” under federal law to not only mean a complete product, but also its individual parts, often included in a weapons parts kit. The new Biden DOJ rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry.“We need to defend the Second Amendment as the Biden administration continues to infringe on American’s constitutional rights,” said Hoeven. “Our resolution would repeal this overreaching rule from the DOJ, ensuring law-abiding citizens are able to continue exercising their Second Amendment rights.”In addition to Hoeven and Cruz, the CRA was introduced by Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), James Risch (R-Idaho), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Josh Hawley (R-Ark.), Tom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Click here to read the resolution.-###-"

Last week, Hoeven visited Del Rio and Eagle Pass, Texas to support CBP officials and North Dakota Guard members and draw attention to their work at the U.S.-Mexico border. The senator also continued working to extend the Title 42 Public Health Order, an important tool that allows immigration officials to return illegal immigrants to their home country and prevent the spread of COVID-19.“I was down in Del Rio and Eagle Pass last week to support our North Dakota Guard members and to draw attention to the growing illegal immigration crisis at the southern border. Our Guard is the eyes and ears of the border patrol. Last year, CBP said they were encountering individuals from 50 different countries at the southern border, now they’re seeing migrants from 100 different countries. In March, there were 220,000 encounters at the southern border and that doesn’t include those who got away. If the administration lifts Public Health Order 42, it will only get worse,” said Hoeven“When I was down there we had two North Dakota Guardsmen who had just saved five migrants who were trying to cross at Del Rio. They went out there and saved them at great risk to themselves. We know what that risk is because we saw what happened to a Texas Guardsman this week who tried to save some migrants. That’s a tragedy. The administration needs to enforce the law and secure the border,” the senator continued.Hoeven has been working to extend the Title 42 Public Health Order, including introducing legislation with Senator Rubio to extend Title 42 until February 2025 and pressing the Biden administration to enforce Title 42 and other key immigration policies. The senator is also working to ensure the Biden administration enforces other key immigration policies, including: Hoeven previously traveled to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to meet with Border Patrol and local leaders on the southern border. Hoeven also traveled with a bipartisan congressional delegation to Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia and Guatemala to discuss the need to work together to stop illegal migration and prevent human and drug trafficking. -###-"

As the lead Republican on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, Hoeven worked to establish the pilot program and helped secure $1 million for the effort through the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 funding legislation.Hoeven also introduced North Dakota rancher Shelly Ziesch at the hearing, where she provided testimony on the challenges facing ranchers in the current market conditions. Ziesch operates a fourth-generation farm and ranch near Pettibone, North Dakota, and currently serves on the North Dakota Farmers Union board of directors.“A cattle contract library is an important tool that supports price discovery and encourages greater competition, which will benefit both producers and consumers. That’s why we funded this pilot program and are working with USDA to keep it moving forward, with the goal of making it a permanent program,” said Hoeven. “With these and other efforts to address the challenges affecting our livestock producers underway, we appreciate Shelly Ziesch for coming to Washington. Her testimony provided a needed North Dakota perspective and helped drive home the importance of ensuring ranchers can access competitive markets.”In addition to advancing the cattle contract library, Hoeven has helped introduce legislation to: -###-"

As a member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Committee, Hoeven secured $27 million for the range to provide a safe, indoor training space for servicemembers, who previously had to conduct combat arms training in an outdoor range, including in harsh weather conditions. Further, the previous range did not meet Air Force training standards and posed increasing health and safety risks. The new indoor range addresses air quality concerns and supports higher quality training, while having lower maintenance costs and remaining available regardless of weather conditions. The range is the third busiest range in the Air Force and is used to provide approximately 9,000 certifications each year.“The airmen and women at the Minot Air Force Base were previously training outdoors, where extreme temperatures and weather provided poor or impossible conditions. At the same time, the range provides 9,000 certifications per year, making it the third busiest in the Air Force. Minot truly needed a state-of-the-art facility to meet these training demands, and it’s why we worked to provide $27 million for this project,” Hoeven said. “As threats grow around the world, our nuclear forces become even more central to our nation’s defense, and we remain committed to making important investments like this and keeping our nuclear modernization programs on schedule so that we have an effective deterrent for decades to come.”In addition, Hoeven outlined the growing importance of maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent and the essential role that Minot fulfills in defending the nation against aggression from its adversaries.

The senator stressed the importance of ensuring the U.S. is energy secure to support a stronger economy, reduce inflation for consumers and businesses and enhance national security, including by reducing the reliance of America and its allies on energy from adversaries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. To this end, Hoeven has advanced the following priorities:“North Dakota can, and should be allowed to, produce more energy. In order to get there, President Biden needs to take the handcuffs off our energy producers, instead of imposing costly restrictions on energy development on federal lands and holding up needed projects, like pipelines,” said Hoeven. “We can restore U.S. energy security by unleashing the full potential of our abundant oil, natural gas and coal reserves and do it with the best environmental stewardship in the world. This will not only help bring down prices and reduce inflation here at home, but it will empower America to export energy to our European allies and reduce their reliance on Russian natural gas. That’s how you cut off the Russian war machine, and it’s the right way forward for our nation.”Securing Approval of Energy ProjectsHoeven has been working to provide regulatory relief for, and help ensure the timely approval of, critically-needed energy infrastructure, including pipelines and transmission lines.

Now, the administration wants to end Title 42 in the coming weeks. This is the wrong approach and will only exacerbate an already impossible situation for our border patrol agents.” In early October, approximately 125 soldiers from the North Dakota Army National Guard left for a year-long mission to the southern border. Hoeven met with the North Dakota soldiers to draw attention to their work at the border. In February 2022, CBP encountered almost 165,000 individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, a 63% increase from February 2021 and a 353% increase from February 2020. Despite the increase in migrants crossing the border, the administration announced that it would rescind the Title 42 Public Health Order on May 23, 2022. Hoeven has been working to extend the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Title 42 Public Health Order, an important tool that allows immigration officials to return illegal immigrants to their home country and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hoeven helped introduce legislation to extend Title 42 until February 2025.

The senators outline the threat to the nation’s food supply should the administration advance its radical environmental agenda mitigating banks’ and credit unions’ exposure to climate risks. “We believe banks and credit unions are well positioned to continue responsibly serving their farm and ranch clients, many of which they have served for decades,” the senators wrote. “Any reduction in lending by banks and credit unions to the agriculture sector – or to any sector that is disliked by its political opponents – would not only harm the businesses themselves, but directly harm consumers due to increased costs of food and energy that would inevitably occur as a result of reduced supply. Further, increasingly onerous federal policies will undercut the agriculture industry’s voluntary investments to deepen their ongoing stewardship of natural resources.”In addition to Hoeven and Thune, the letter was signed by Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Click here for the full text of the letter.              -###-Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/congress-passes-hoeven-sponsored-legislation-to-enhance-shadow-wolves-expand-operation-to-northern-border1,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the House companion to the Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act, legislation introduced in the Senate by Hoeven and Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). This bipartisan, bicameral legislation classifies the Tohono O’odham Shadow Wolves unit as special agents, allowing them to better patrol, investigate, interdict and secure the southern border. The legislation also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan to expand the Shadow Wolves program to other parts of the United States, including the northern border. This will allow the Shadow Wolves program to be utilized in other tribal areas throughout the country, enhancing border security by helping prevent illegal contraband from coming across the borders.“We need to secure our southern border and stem the tide of illegal crossings, which allow for human and drug trafficking and undermine the security of our nation,” said Senator Hoeven. “The Shadow Wolves do tremendous work securing the shared border between the Tohono O’odham Nation and Mexico. Our legislation would strengthen their mission and enable them to utilize more of their skills and expertise along the southern border. Importantly, it would also call on the Homeland Security Department to put forth a plan to expand the Shadow Wolves to other tribal communities, including those near the northern border.”“The Tohono O’Oodham Nation’s Shadow Wolves serve as critical partners to help combat drug smuggling, human trafficking, and other illicit activity on the southwest border. I’m proud both the U.S. Senate and House passed our legislation with bipartisan support, entrusting the Shadow Wolves with more authority to investigate and interdict illegal border activity and keep Arizona families safe and secure,” said Senator Sinema. Shadow Wolves are members of the Tohono O’odham Nation who work for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. Shadow Wolves patrol the 76-mile stretch of land the Nation shares with Mexico and are known for their ability to track drug traffickers. The Hoeven-Sinema bill reclassifies Shadow Wolves from tactical officers to special agents, allowing the unit to better investigate and track cross-border criminal activity. The bill also provides the ability to expand the Shadow Wolves program to other parts of the country, including areas along the northern border.In November, the Hoeven/Sinema Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act advanced out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The U.S. House passed the companion to the Hoeven-Sinema bill (H.R. 5681) earlier this month, and with Senate passage of H.R. 5681, the bill will now go to the president.  -###- Pursuant to Senate Policy, petitions, opinion polls and unsolicited mass electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60-day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election.

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-biden-administration-not-helping-solve-high-energy-prices_its-energy-policies-are-the-problem,"WASHINGTON – At a press conference with his Senate Republican colleagues this week, Senator John Hoeven pushed back on the Biden administration’s policies that are hurting Americans at the gas pump and driving up prices across the economy.“The Biden administration needs to take the handcuffs off our energy producers. We can produce a lot more oil and natural gas, and do it with the best environmental stewardship in the world,” said Hoeven. “This is supply and demand. Two years ago, the U.S. was producing just under 13 million barrels per day of oil, and now we’re down to about 11.5 million barrels per day. That’s less supply because of the Biden administration’s policies.“It starts with the moratorium on leasing for federal lands, both onshore and offshore. The Biden administration says energy companies have the leases, but if you hold up the lease with regulation and court challenges, they can’t produce energy on that land. That’s exactly what the Biden administration is doing.“Then, they’re holding up our ability to move oil and gas across the country by blocking pipelines. In 2015, I introduced S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. We passed it through the Senate and the House, and President Obama vetoed it. If not for that, the pipeline would be bringing nearly a million barrels of oil per day from our closest friend and ally Canada. That’s oil we now don’t have.“We have stranded natural gas in North Dakota because we can’t get the permits for the gathering systems and pipelines we need to get it to market, let alone to our allies. We also need LNG facilities to get our natural gas to Europe. If we want to continue to cut off the Russia war machine, we need to cut off their ability to sell energy.“To the Biden administration – until you change your energy policy, don’t tell Americans you’re trying to help. Your policy is the problem.” -###-"

https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-statement-after-voting-to-ban-russian-oil-imports-suspend-normal-trade-relations-with-russia-and-belarus,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today issued the following statement after the Senate approved legislation to ban imports of Russian energy products, and legislation to suspend permanent normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus:“Given Russia’s unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it is clear that we should ban imports of Russian energy products. Preventing imports of Russian oil, gas and coal is vital to cutting off funding for Russia’s war effort. There’s no reason an energy-rich nation like ours should be getting energy from Russia. Now, we need the Biden administration to take the handcuffs of our domestic energy producers so we can produce more energy for consumers here at home as well as to help our allies,” said Hoeven. “Additionally, we also approved legislation to suspend trade relations with Russia and Belarus, which is another important step in holding both countries accountable for the unprovoked attacks against Ukraine.”Over the past month, Hoeven has been working to stop Russian energy imports while promoting U.S. energy production. The senator joined Senator Roger Marshall in introducing legislation to ban the U.S. from purchasing Russian oil and to remove Russian fuels from American supply chains, and also cosponsored legislation introduced by Senators Manchin and Murkowski prohibiting the imports of Russian oil, petroleum products, liquefied natural gas and coal. At the same time, Hoeven introduced the American Energy Independence from Russia Act, bicameral legislation that takes immediate action to increase U.S. energy production and reduce reliance on Russian energy. This includes: -###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-helps-introduce-legislation-to-extend-title-42-until-2025,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven joined Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in introducing legislation to extend the Title 42 authority at the nation’s southern border until February 2025. At present, the Title 42 Public Health Order allows Homeland Security and immigration officials to expeditiously return illegal immigrants to their home country in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This legislation comes in response to the Biden administration deciding to rescind the Title 42 authority, which will lead to an additional surge of illegal immigrants coming across the southern border.“I’ve been to the southern border and seen firsthand the surge of illegal immigrants crossing our nation’s southern border,” said Hoeven. “President Biden’s decision to revoke Title 42 will make the situation drastically worse. The Biden administration needs to enforce the law and secure our southern border, and this legislation is about empowering our immigration officials to do just that.”In addition to Hoeven and Rubio, the bill was introduced by Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).  -###-"

The Real Emergencies Act would reaffirm that the president is prohibited from using the three primary statutory authorities available to him – the National Emergencies Act, the Stafford Act, and section 319 of the Public Health Service Act – to declare a national emergency solely on the basis of climate change.“Consumers are paying record energy prices because the Biden administration is taking the wrong approach to energy development for our nation and continues to put up roadblocks for our domestic energy producers,” said Hoeven. “We introduced the Real Emergencies Act to stop the president from continuing to target our energy industry, and prevent him from weaponizing national emergency powers to block oil and gas development. This is part of our efforts to push back on the Biden administration and instead empower domestic energy production so that we can utilize America’s abundant oil and natural gas reserves.”In addition to Hoeven and Capito, the legislation was introduced by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.). -###-  "

After reviewing Judge Jackson’s record and meeting with her today, I am concerned that she will not strictly uphold the Constitution and law as written, and will engage in judicial activism. I am also concerned by her history of providing sentences below sentencing guidelines and her treatment of terrorists at Guantanamo as criminals rather than prisoners of war. For these reasons I cannot support her nomination to the Supreme Court.”-###-"

Geoffrey Van Epps, Commander of the Northwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, urging him to: “With the ongoing drought in western North Dakota, we continue pressing the Corps to ensure we have access to Lake Sakakawea,” said Hoeven. “We need regulatory relief and funding so that boat ramps are extended and other steps are taken to ensure access to the lake for this spring and summer.”The meeting builds on a recent letter that Hoeven sent to Army Corps Chief Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon outlining the maintenance needs in the region. The senator also previously met with Col. Mark Himes, Commander of the Army Corps’ Omaha District, to discuss efforts to appoint a drought coordinator, establish a regional general permit to expedite drought-related projects and secure funding for maintenance.Prior to this, Hoeven worked to include report language in annual appropriations legislation directing the Corps to work with local stakeholders on a long-term sustainable plan to restore and maintain recreational facilities near Lake Sakakawea and Lake Oahe.Stakeholders can obtain Missouri River updates from the Water Management Division at https://www.nwd-mr.usace.army.mil/rcc/index.html.  -###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-senate-passes-ocean-shipping-reform-act,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after the Senate passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, legislation which will update federal regulations for the global shipping industry and help American producers export their products internationally. As one of the four lead sponsors of the bipartisan legislation, Hoeven, along with Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), John Thune (R-S.D.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), helped shepherd the bill through the Senate. The legislation helps address supply chain challenges by prohibiting ocean carriers from unreasonably declining shipping opportunities for U.S. exports, making it harder for ocean carriers to arbitrarily turn away goods at ports that are ready to be shipped abroad. Further, the bill would give the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), the federal agency responsible for the regulation of ocean-borne transportation, greater authority to regulate harmful practices by carriers. “North Dakota has a positive balance of trade thanks to the hard work of our farmers, ranchers, energy producers, manufacturers and other exporters, benefitting both the state and national economies,” said Hoeven. “Their continued success relies on fair and reliable market access. Our legislation would hold foreign ocean carriers accountable, prohibiting them from unreasonably declining opportunities for U.S. exports, and would empower the FMC to ensure our domestic shippers have access to a fair, reasonable and effective marketplace.”The Ocean Shipping Reform Act would: -###- "

In an energy rich nation like ours, consumers should not be burdened by skyrocketing energy prices,” said Hoeven. “Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and calling on OPEC to produce more oil are not real long-term solutions, and won’t provide hardworking families relief at the pump. Instead, the administration should take the handcuffs off our domestic energy industry and empower them to increase production and utilize the full potential of America’s abundant oil and natural gas reserves.” Hoeven continues working to push back on the Biden administration’s harmful agenda and ensure the U.S. remains energy secure. His efforts include: -###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-livestock-disaster-assistance-payments-to-producers-will-start-next-week,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will begin sending livestock disaster assistance payments next week. USDA today released details on phase one of the Emergency Livestock Relief Program (ELRP), which is funded from the $750 million that Hoeven secured in September to aid livestock producers. Since then, Hoeven has repeatedly pressed USDA officials, including Secretary Tom Vilsack, Under Secretary Robert Bonnie and FSA Administrator Zach Ducheneaux, to provide the assistance as soon as possible and in a way that works for ranchers. The Emergency Livestock Relief Program:“We secured this $750 million to help ranchers recover from last year’s historic drought, and the payments come as a needed relief, especially as producers are facing increased costs across the board,” said Hoeven. “That’s why we’ve repeatedly urged USDA to move this program forward and called for payments to be based on LFP applications, which streamlines the process for ranchers. With these payments starting next week, we will continue pressing to get remaining disaster assistance out the door for all of our agriculture producers as soon as possible.”To be eligible for ELRP, livestock producers must have suffered grazing losses in a county rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a D2 (severe drought) for eight consecutive weeks or a D3 (extreme drought) or higher level of drought intensity during the 2021 calendar year, and have applied and been approved for 2021 LFP. USDA expects to distribute more than $577 million through ELRP phase one. Phase two will begin later this year.Hoeven worked to secure the $750 million for livestock producers as part of $10 billion in disaster aid, which also includes $9.25 billion in disaster funding to aid row crop producers who suffered losses due to droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other qualifying disasters in calendar years 2020 and 2021. USDA will provide that assistance using existing crop insurance data in a two-phase approach as well, beginning this spring.Additionally, USDA is expanding the Emergency Assistance for Livestock Program (ELAP) to cover above normal costs of hauling livestock to forage. This follows the expansion of ELAP to compensate ranchers for increased costs of hauling feed to livestock, which the department implemented at the request of Hoeven.Producers should contact their FSA county office or visit farmers.gov for more information. In addition to the disaster funding, the senator has worked to provide producers with tools and support during the drought, including: -###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-biden-administration-needs-to-enforce-the-law-secure-the-southern-border,"WASHINGTON – At a press conference with his Senate Republican colleagues today, Senator John Hoeven called on the Biden administration to enforce the law and secure the nation’s borders. The senator outlined the ongoing illegal immigration crisis at the southern border and highlighted three key policies that the administration should fully enforce, including: “Our message is simple – the Biden administration needs to enforce the law,” said Hoeven. “We know that Title 42, the MPP and Safe Third Country Agreements work. The Trump administration proved it. The Biden administration has chosen to not enforce these laws, and look what happened. We had 1.7 million people crossing the border illegally in 2021, and this year we are on track to have even more, with 165,000 illegal crossings just last month. Democrats need to join with Republicans in Congress, along with people across the country, and demand that the administration uphold the law.”-###- "

In the letter, the senators press for a strategy to help ensure Ukraine returns to sovereignty and freedom following Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine that started more than one month ago. “The U.S. mission in Ukraine must go beyond ensuring the country merely has the means to defend itself against Russian aggression. The strategy must deliver Ukraine necessary weapons to defend itself, counter the Russian forces’ advance, and give the Ukrainian people a chance to win this war. Success cannot be a Russian-occupied Ukraine – it must be a free, independent, and sovereign Ukraine. Authoritarianism cannot prevail in this conflict. Defending freedom in Ukraine is defending freedom everywhere,” the senators wrote. In addition to Hoeven, Ernst and Gillibrand, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.).Click here for the full text of the letter.  -###- "

In the bipartisan letter, the senators highlight the commission as unfair, unwarranted and singling out Israel, further fueling anti-Semitism. With the United States returning as a member of the UNHRC earlier this year, the senators urge the secretary to use America’s position to redirect resources from wasteful and biased investigations into Israel and instead focus on human rights crises around the world.“We urge you to act upon the Administration’s commitment to defend Israel from discriminatory treatment at the Human Rights Council and throughout the UN system,” the senators wrote.   In addition to Hoeven, Portman and Cardin, the letter is signed by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY), Jim Risch (R-ID), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Thune (R-SD), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Susan Collins (R-ME), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), John Boozman (R-AR), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Margaret Hassan (D-NH), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Patty Murray (D-WA), Joni Enrst (R-IA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Cornyn (R-TX), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Tim Scott (R-SC), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mike Braun (R-IN), Mark Warner (D-VA), Rick Scott (R-FL), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Bob Casey (D-PA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mike Lee (R-UT), Raphael Warnock (R-GA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Jon Tester (D-MT), Todd Young (R-IN), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Mike Crapo (R-ID). Click here for the full text of the letter. -###-"
https://www.hoeven.senate.gov/news/news-releases/hoeven-statement-after-voting-for-legislation-to-impose-sanctions-on-nord-stream-2-pipeline,"WASHINGTON – Senator John Hoeven today issued the following statement after voting for legislation to impose mandatory sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry natural gas produced in Russia to the European market. The legislation would impose mandatory sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as well as any corporate officer of an entity planning, constructing or operating the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and would subject any removal of the sanctions to congressional review. However, the legislation was blocked from passage by Senate Democrats.“The Biden administration continues to undermine North American energy production, while allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” said Hoeven. “The Biden administration’s support for more Russian energy delivery to Europe makes the U.S., our allies and our partners in Europe less secure. Enforcing sanctions on Nord Stream 2 is a significant method of deterring Russian aggression against Ukraine.”Hoeven has repeatedly pressed the administration to counter Russia’s influence over America’s allies in Europe. This includes urging President Biden, in recent letters led by Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), to follow U.S. law and impose congressionally-mandated sanctions on the company leading the Nord Stream 2 project. Hoeven also helped introduce legislation sponsored by Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) to reinstate and expand the sanctions being waived by the Biden administration on Russia and the entities involved in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline’s construction. -###-"

The senator joined a bicameral effort, led by Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.), in filing an amicus brief arguing that Congress did not give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) the authority to impose a vaccine mandate and urging the court to stay the mandate. The full text of the brief can be read here.“Today’s Supreme Court ruling blocks President Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate on private employers and prevents it from being enforced,” said Hoeven. “The administration’s mandate is a clear violation of individual rights, and we appreciate the Court agreeing with our argument that the mandate goes far beyond any authority granted by Congress.”Hoeven has been pushing back on the Biden administration’s overreaching vaccine mandates. In addition to the amicus brief, Hoeven previously helped introduce and voted to advance a Congressional Review Act (CRA) Resolution of Disapproval against the vaccine mandate for private businesses. A CRA resolution is the official process for Congress to eliminate an executive branch rule. The resolution passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote last month. -###-"
