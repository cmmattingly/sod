https://www.sinema.senate.gov/addressing-rising-crime-sinema-introduces-bipartisan-bill-keeping-arizona-communities-tribes-safe,"WASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema introduced bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the U.S. Department of Justice’s Project Safe Neighborhood program to keep Arizona and Tribal communities safe. The Project Safe Neighborhood program brings together federal, state, local, and Tribal law enforcement, prosecutors, community leaders, and partners to identify and address the most pressing crime problems in their communities.
 
“Arizona communities should be safe – free of violence and crime. Our bipartisan legislation supporting the Project Safe Neighborhoods program will reduce violence, protect communities, and help ensure Arizona families are safe and secure,” said Sinema.
 
“The Project Safe Neighborhoods program has been proven to reduce violent crime in cities that participate by focusing law enforcement efforts on organized crime networks and repeat offenders,” said Cornyn. “By fostering partnerships between federal, state, and local law enforcement to address these criminal threats, we can take a more proactive approach to protecting our communities from violent criminals.”
 
Sinema’s bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Project Safe Neighborhoods program, which plays a critical role in protecting Arizona communities and tribes from crime and gang violence. The Senator’s bipartisan bill empowers local leaders to collaborate with federal partners to address crime and foster safer neighborhoods, while sustaining the long-term reduction in violent crime in their communities. Sinema introduced the bill with a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues, including Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).
 
In December 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice awarded an additional $370,000 to the District of Arizona for Project Safe Neighborhoods programs used in the state. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona has partnered with various local, state, tribal, federal, and non-governmental agencies to identify high gun-crime areas and target its resources to combat violent offenders.
 
Sinema’s legislation is part of her work in keeping Arizona communities safe and secure. Earlier this year, Sinema’s Bipartisan Safer Communities Act addressing violence and mental health was signed into law. The Senator’s bipartisan law invests in support for state crisis intervention orders, children and family mental health services, protections for victims of domestic violence, funding for school-based mental health services – all the while not raising taxes on everyday Arizonans and respecting Americans’ Second Amendment rights."

The Senator specifically highlighted how cartels utilize social media to recruit teenage Arizonans for smuggling operations.
 
“Every day, cartels post on social media platforms and recruit teenagers in Arizona to act as drivers for illegal operations. Lured by the promise of easy cash, these teens – some as young as 14 – then take their parents’ cars to the border and participate in smuggling and trafficking… The Department of Homeland Security must do more to crack down on dangerous cartels’ use of social media, secure the border, and keep Arizona families safe,” said Sinema, Chair of the Border Management Subcommittee.
 
Sinema focused her line of questioning on how the algorithms used by social media platforms can amplify and promote cartel-sponsored content. The Senator highlighted that the lives of innocent bystanders and migrants are put at risk when these recruited teenagers flee law enforcement at high speeds.
 
The Senator asked TikTok and Meta executives about what their companies are doing to prevent these harms and stop cartels from using their platforms to recruit teenagers along Arizona’s border. During the hearing, the Senator secured a commitment from Meta, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube to share cartel content with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as quickly as possible.
 
Additionally, the Senator questioned representatives from TikTok, which is owned by a China-based company, about the real risk that the platform could alter its algorithm to promote or censor content on Beijing’s behalf – whether that means silencing voices critical of China or promoting conspiracies and extremist content. The Senator also pressed TikTok on whether it collects biometric data from Americans that could potentially be shared with China.

“Strengthening the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program is critical to protecting Arizonans’ privacy and shielding Arizona businesses from bad actors taking advantage of unsecured internet connections,” said Sinema.
 
The Federal Communications Commission’s Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program allows small telecommunications providers to remove network equipment that may allow foreign interference. 
 
Currently, the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program faces a potential shortfall, leaving wireless networks – especially in rural areas – vulnerable to disruption from bad actors. Sinema is seeking to strengthen investments in this program that will allow the removal, disposal, and replacement of potentially compromised network equipment which can leave American wireless networks vulnerable to espionage and disruption.
 
Arizona’s critical infrastructure – including power plants, military bases, police stations, and fire houses – should not be at risk by using potentially suspect technology that could be compromised by foreign governments. Removing this suspect technology protects Arizona families and small businesses from having their personal information and privacy accessed by bad actors.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-hualapai-chairman-clarke-discuss-legislation-securing-tribes-water-future,"Sinema introduced legislation delivering the Tribe’s water agreement
Sinema recently secured $4 billion for drought resiliency in the Inflation Reduction LawWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Hualapai Tribe Chairman Damon Clarke discussed Sinema’s Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act – legislation that ratifies the Hualapai Tribe’s Colorado River water settlement agreement that delivers approximately 4,000 acre-feet of water per year to the Tribe – and her efforts securing $4 billion in drought resiliency in the recently signed-into-law Inflation Reduction Act. 
 
“Securing Arizona’s and the Hualapai Tribe’s water future is critical to our state’s economic success. I’m grateful for Chairman Clarke’s partnership and collaboration in delivering this goal,” said Sinema.
 
In July, Sinema introduced Chairman Clarke during a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing, where the Chairman testified in support of Sinema’s Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act. Sinema’s legislation meets a historic moment after the Hualapai Tribe worked for a decade to secure an agreement with the U.S. Departments of State and Interior. Sinema’s Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act approves Hualapai Tribe’s water rights claims, as well as other allottees in Arizona, and authorizes construction of a water project related to the water rights claims – delivering 4,000-acre feet of water per year.
 
Additionally, Sinema’s legislation establishes the Hualapai Water Trust Fund Account and the Hualapai Water Settlement Implementation Fund Account, with $180 million and $5 million, respectively, authorized until expended. These accounts are for construction, operations and maintenance, technical assistance, and environmental compliance costs associated with the pipeline from the Colorado River.
 
Currently, the Hualapai Tribe relies on groundwater alone to meet their water needs – which is not a permanent or sustainable solution. Sinema’s legislation provides a solution that would help meet the Tribe’s water needs.
 
While negotiating the Inflation Reduction Act, Sinema personally ensured a $4 billion investment in drought resiliency for Arizona and the entire American West. Sinema would not support the Inflation Reduction Act without ensuring the legislation included adequate climate resources to secure Arizona’s water and economic future."
https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-meets-arizona-farm-bureau-receives-friend-farm-bureau-award-securing-historic-investments,"The Arizona Farm Bureau highlighted how Sinema’s work will alleviate agricultural challenges caused by the ongoing droughtWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema met with representatives from the Arizona Farm Bureau to discuss the needs and priorities of Arizona’s agricultural industry in light of the ongoing drought, recent water cutbacks, and the upcoming 2023 Farm Bill. 
 
During the meeting, the Arizona Farm Bureau presented Sinema with the “Friend of the Farm Bureau” award – a distinction she has earned twice before for her work supporting Arizona’s agriculture and, most recently, securing historic investments for drought resilience in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law and Inflation Reduction law.
 
“I’m grateful to hear about how we can continue partnering with Arizona’s farmers, ranchers, and agricultural leaders to deliver lasting results addressing the ongoing drought so they can continue growing and fueling our economy. I’m incredibly humbled to receive the Friend of the Farm Bureau award – and I look forward to continuing our partnership as we boost Arizona’s agricultural industry so it can continue to thrive for years to come,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
Per the 2007 Interim Guidelines and Drought Contingency Plan, Arizona will see a reduction of 592,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water next year, and Sinema has repeatedly heard concerns from farmers throughout the state about future water reductions. As it stands, Pinal County farmers are positioned to be among those hit hardest by the Drought Contingency Plan Tier 1 cuts, losing almost all of their Central Arizona Project water allocations. Last month, Sinema successfully secured a historic $4 billion for drought mitigation across the American West in the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Sinema co-authored and led negotiations for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law, which makes historic investments in drought resilience.
 
During the meeting, representatives from the Arizona Farm Bureau thanked Sinema for her solutions-based approach in delivering drought resilience funding for Colorado River Basin states to address ongoing drought conditions, which are the worst they’ve been in 1,200 years.
 
In August, Sinema held a roundtable with Arizona farmers and ranchers from the Arizona Farm Bureau in Pinal County to discuss their priorities as she shapes the 2023 Farm Bill and implements the historic investments for the region from her bipartisan infrastructure law. In February, Sinema also hosted a roundtable discussion with Arizona farmers, ranchers, and agriculture leaders from the Arizona Farm Bureau on their infrastructure priorities.

During the hearing, Sinema highlighted her bipartisan Senate pandemic risk working group’s role in creating and advancing an insurance framework that will reduce the price tag of any future pandemic response and address some of the waste, fraud, and abuse observed with respect to pandemic aid. 
 
“Our response to future pandemics needs to be leaner, faster, and smarter, and it is important to me that future responses are more fiscally responsible, as it is clear that the risk of overspending coupled with supply chain disruptions can trigger an inflationary response,” said Sinema, a member of the Senate Banking Committee. 
 
One of the witnesses in attendance was Commissioner Kathleen A. Birrane of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, whom Sinema questioned about enhancing insurance affordability for small business owners in Arizona. Sinema expressed her preference for a solution that includes a framework allowing small businesses to purchase subsidized coverage so business owners know exactly how much coverage they are getting.
 
Additionally, Sinema shared with the witnesses her determination in identifying a bipartisan federal solution to insurance issues as they relate to future pandemic responses, ensuring any future response is thoughtful, targeted, and reflective of the concerns of Arizona businesses.
 
Last year, Sinema and her staff convened a bipartisan Senate working group with other members of the Senate Banking Committee to advance solutions around risk-sharing and future pandemics. Their goal is to improve the resiliency of the U.S. economy to future pandemic-related economic shocks by creating an insurance framework that brings forward the power of the private sector and provides business owners with choices to buy coverage that aligns with their needs and their risk tolerance.

The late Arizona Senator John McCain was aboard the carrier, surviving the naval disaster 3 months before becoming a prisoner of warWASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan resolution backed by Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema honoring the 134 servicemembers, including two from Arizona, lost in the USS Forrestal Fire on July 29, 1967. The late Arizona Senator John McCain survived the fire 3 months prior to becoming a prisoner of war.
 
“Our bipartisan resolution acknowledges the 55th anniversary of the tragic USS Forrestal Fire, and honors the brave servicemembers who gave their lives for their shipmates. I’m glad the Senate came together to recognize their courage,” said Sinema.
 
The accidental launch of a rocket caused a fire on the USS Forrestal, a U.S. Navy carrier off the coast of Vietnam, on July 29, 1967. For 18 hours, sailors and marines on the USS Forrestal, assisted by helicopters and crews from other ships, fought to control the fire. Tragically, the accidental fire killed 134 American servicemembers, including Airman Joseph Kosik III of Tucson and Lieutenant Commander Fred White of Phoenix, and injured an additional 161. At the time, it was the worst loss of life on a U.S. Navy ship since World War II.
 
The resolution — which passed the Senate with bipartisan support — maintains that the loss of life could have been much worse had it not been for the selflessness of the servicemembers onboard who fought to control the disaster.
 
Senator John McCain was aboard the carrier at the time and survived the naval disaster before becoming a prisoner of war 3 months later. Sinema’s resolution remembers and honors Senator McCain’s legacy – a personal hero to Sinema and countless Arizonans and Americans.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-talks-closing-digital-divide-arizona-state-university-congressional-conference,"Senator highlighted the $65 billion her Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law makes in deploying high-speed broadband to unserved and underserved communities – including Tribal and rural areas – in Arizona and across the country
Senator applauded Arizona State University’s innovative approach to digital equity and ensuring connectivity for studentsTEMPE – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema spoke at Arizona State University’s Advancing Innovation & Access in Digital Learning Congressional Conference about the importance of internet connectivity and digital equity, and the strides her bipartisan infrastructure law makes towards closing Arizona’s digital divide. Sinema applauded Arizona State University (ASU) for its leadership in serving those without reliable internet access.
 
“During the pandemic, we all quickly learned first-hand that families across Arizona depend on reliable and high-speed internet... Without it, students can’t learn, patients can’t access health care, and businesses can’t thrive. That’s why, when I led negotiations on the bipartisan infrastructure law, I ensured we included historic levels of investments in our nation’s infrastructure so we could expand internet access to the last mile of our state. ASU – with a talented faculty and innovative resources – will continue to be a force in leading our state and its students into a new digital future,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law. 
 
Sinema’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law makes historic and sweeping investments in repairing and upgrading America’s critical infrastructure, including $65 billion to deploy high-speed broadband, expand broadband internet access, and help families afford broadband service. Specifically, Sinema’s law invests over $14 billion to make internet more affordable and requires internet providers to offer a low-cost option to participate in federal broadband deployment funding. Following passage of the infrastructure law, the Federal Communications Commission established the Affordable Connectivity Program using the funding Sinema secured to help Arizonans access affordable internet. The program provides eligible families $30 a month toward their internet bills and $75 a month toward internet service in tribal areas.
 
For seven years in a row, ASU has been recognized as the nation’s most innovative university. During her remarks, Sinema noted that ASU’s partnership with the Future of Tech Commission – a collaboration that brings together the ASU community with an independent and bipartisan group of leaders to develop solutions addressing Arizona’s digital divide – represents the strong, innovative steps towards digital equity ASU is undertaking. 
 
Last month, Sinema and fellow Arizona Senator Mark Kelly announced nearly $3 million for Diné College’s CONNECT NAVAJO Project — an initiative to improve educational opportunity on the Navajo Nation by improving internet access, providing more hardware, and investing in information technology (IT) personnel.

Sinema also highlighted the historic investments her bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law – which she negotiated, co-authored, and led into law – provides for Flagstaff, including once-in-a-generation funds preventing and mitigating the devastating impacts of floods and wildfires.
 
“It’s always a pleasure hearing from Arizonans – especially the trailblazing, inspiring women of the Flagstaff Women’s Leadership Network. I’m committed to working closely with them to maximize opportunities and deliver lasting solutions for our state for years to come,” said Sinema.
 
The Flagstaff Women’s Leadership Network is comprised of small business owners, real estate professionals, health care administrators, educators, and government leaders. The group is focused on connecting women, fostering mentorship among female leadership professionals, and promoting community service. Sinema has previously met with the leadership network to discuss policies relating to transportation infrastructure, affordable housing, and more.
 
During her discussion with the leadership network, Sinema touted the multiple bipartisan achievements she helped pass into law during this Congress alone – including the Chips and Science Act, PACT Act, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, Postal Service Reform Act, and, critically, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
 
Sinema has recently visited Flagstaff twice to underscore the investments her Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law make in preventing and mitigating the devastating impacts of floods and wildfires in the region.
 
Earlier this month, Sinema received a briefing and tour in Flagstaff to hear and see firsthand the flood mitigation and recovery efforts impacting areas near the previous site of the Pipeline Fire. In May, Sinema visited Flagstaff to see the damage caused by the Tunnel Fire – which burned nearly 20,000 acres northeast of Flagstaff – and receive a briefing from the U.S. Forest Service. Sinema’s bipartisan infrastructure law authorizes a once-in-a-generation $8.25 billion for wildfire management, resiliency, restoration, and natural resources-related infrastructure, and includes a historic $12 billion for flood mitigation efforts.
 
Earlier this year, Sinema, along with fellow Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, announced $3,500,000 for the City of Flagstaff’s Watershed Protection Project – funding both Senators secured in the annual budget bill. 
 
Sinema pledged to work with local leaders like the Flagstaff Women’s Leadership Network to ensure the region receives the funding it’s owed.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-speaks-greater-phoenix-chamber-commerce-about-expanding-economic-opportunities-arizona,"Senator honored for her support of pro-growth policies driving Arizona’s small business economy forwardPHOENIX – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema spoke with the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce about her work expanding economic opportunity, lowering prices, and advancing pro-growth policies for Arizona’s business community. The Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce presented Sinema with the Advocate for American Business award, highlighting her role in creating jobs and spurring innovation across Arizona.
 
“I’m honored to receive the Advocate for American Business award. I’ll always work to protect and strengthen small businesses across our state – and I look forward to continuing to deliver lasting solutions expanding our state’s competitiveness, fueling innovation, and creating opportunity for Arizonans,” said Sinema. 
 
Roughly 99.5% of Arizona’s businesses are small businesses, underscoring the importance of advancing pro-growth policies that promote economic competitiveness and ensure small and mid-sized businesses have the resources they need to thrive.
 
Sinema shared with the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce her role in shaping the Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law this week, to ensure it met her two main goals: helping Arizona's economy grow and compete, and boosting drought and climate resources for Arizona and the entire American West.
 
For over a year, Sinema heard from local employers across Arizona underscoring their concerns with changing tax policies that would hinder their ability to create jobs, grow our economy, and compete. Sinema has been consistent that she supports tax reforms and revenue options that target tax avoidance, make the tax code more efficient, and support Arizona's economic growth and competitiveness. Sinema acknowledged to the Chamber that, at a time of record inflation, rising interest rates, and slowing economic growth, disincentivizing investments in Arizona businesses would hurt Arizona’s economy’s ability to create jobs, so she ensured the Inflation Reduction Act helps Arizona’s economy thrive. 
 
Sinema also recognized that Arizona’s economic prosperity hinges on the state’s water security and future, which is why she withheld her support for the Inflation Reduction Act until significant resources for drought resiliency were included. The final package includes an extra $4 billion for drought mitigation, funding Sinema and Arizona water experts insist was necessary to preserve shrinking water levels and enhance water reliability in the American West."

Sinema’s meeting follows her success securing $4 billion in the recent Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act for drought mitigation across the American West CASA GRANDE – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema held a roundtable with Arizona farmers and ranchers from the Arizona Farm Bureau in Pinal County to discuss their priorities as she shapes the 2023 Farm Bill and implements historic investments for the region from her bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law and the Inflation Reduction Act. 
 
During the meeting, Sinema heard from farmers and ranchers about the importance of strengthening Arizona’s water reliability to secure the state’s water future. Sinema’s visit follows her success securing significant funding strengthening drought mitigation and resilience in the last year – including more than $8 billion in Western water infrastructure from her historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law and, most recently, an additional $4 billion in the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act.
 
“Arizona’s farmers and ranchers know best about the challenges – and opportunities – facing our agricultural industry. I’m glad to count them as critical partners as we continue implementing and advocating for crucial investments that will help them grow and thrive,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law. 
 
Prior to the roundtable, Sinema toured Desperado Dairy to better understand agricultural needs as she helps craft the 2023 Farm Bill. The Farm Bill is updated and passed every five years, with the current package set to expire next year. Sinema has pledged to work hand-in-hand with Arizona agricultural experts to ensure the new package adequately reflects Arizona’s needs and priorities, including bolstered resources for drought and wildfire mitigation and recovery.
 
The purpose of Sinema’s visit is in-part due to the funding she secured to mitigate Arizona’s ongoing drought crisis, which is the worst it’s been in 1,200 years, and how it will provide relief to the agricultural industry amid water cutbacks. As it stands, Pinal County farmers are positioned to be among those hit hardest by the Drought Contingency Plan Tier 1 cuts, losing almost all of their Central Arizona Project water allocations. Last weekend, Sinema secured $4 billion for drought mitigation across the American West in the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Sinema co-authored and led negotiations for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law, which makes historic investments in drought resilience.
 
In February, Sinema hosted a roundtable discussion with Arizona farmers, ranchers, and agriculture leaders from the Arizona Farm Bureau on their infrastructure priorities, and highlighted the positive impacts her bipartisan infrastructure law makes in strengthening the long-term sustainability of multi-generation family farms.

Sinema and Kelly both ensured their bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law increased RAISE grants’ ability to invest in Arizona cities.
 
The transportation projects range from advancing the late John McCain’s Rio Reimagined vision of revitalizing the Rio Salado River with a new bike and pedestrian bridge, to replacing a structurally deficient bridge in an economically distressed part of Tucson, to conducting vital research in Navajo County to improve safety measures, to rural road reconstruction in Mohave, and more.
 
“Today’s grant funding will better connect communities across Arizona, improve safety, lower emissions, and expand economic opportunity for our state. This is the direct result of our advocacy to increase funding for RAISE grants in our bipartisan infrastructure law, and I couldn’t be more proud to see them put to great use,” said Senator Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
“A year ago, we worked with Republicans and Democrats to negotiate and pass our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law so we can rebuild and upgrade critical infrastructure in communities across Arizona. Thanks to our work, we are proud to announce these grants that will support infrastructure projects in Phoenix, Tucson, Navajo County, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes. These projects will create more Arizona jobs while improving the safety and efficiency of Arizonans’ commutes to and from school, work, and doctor's appointments. I will continue working closely with Arizona leaders to make sure our state takes full advantage of this historic investment in American infrastructure,” said Senator Kelly.
 
RAISE – Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity – grants are awarded based on applications from local municipalities, allowing the Department of Transportation to invest in road, rail, transit, and port projects that promise to achieve national objectives. Sinema and Kelly both ensured their Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law included increased funding for RAISE Grants, helping to boost Arizona infrastructure projects for years to come.

Sinema also highlighted how her bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law strengthens supply chains and boosts responsible production of critical minerals mining and research that strengthen our national defense.
 
Sinema’s meeting follows up on previous discussions with mining and defense leaders from Arizona, representing her focus on engaging and partnering with Arizonans to address supply chain challenges, lower the cost of goods, expand economic opportunity, and help everyday families return to normal. 
 
“Arizona is a hub for innovation – where cutting-edge technologies are created and brought to market, helping America compete globally while ensuring a safer world. I’m focused on addressing inflation and supply chain challenges affecting Arizona families and businesses – and I remain committed to supporting the needs of Arizona’s defense, mining, and clean energy industries so Arizona can continue to grow, thrive, and lead,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
In May, Sinema backed new, bipartisan legislation investing in Arizona’s energy future by supporting jobs and university mining educational programs focused on extracting critical minerals, rare earth minerals, and mine remediation. The University of Arizona – where Sinema’s roundtable was hosted – would be positioned to earn grants under Sinema’s bipartisan legislation for their mining and geological engineering program.
 
Critical minerals remain essential components for the clean energy products and infrastructure of the future, and are integral to bolstering national defense. During the roundtable, Sinema highlighted the historic responsible investments in Arizona mining, clean energy technologies, and critical minerals in her bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
Sinema’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law funds a federal study of the use of abandoned mine lands and mine waste for critical minerals extraction as part of the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. The bipartisan legislation also invests billions of dollars into new grants, facilities, and programs – many of which Arizona is expected to compete for – including: 
The recent Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act includes provisions further investing in the responsible production of critical minerals, including:

“Arizonans expect the IRS to responsibly do its job in serving taxpayers, and the economic uncertainty caused by the IRS’s backlogs is unacceptable. We’ll continue to hold the IRS accountable in meeting Arizonans’ expectations,” said Sinema.
 
In her bipartisan letter, Sinema urges the IRS to extend the suspension of automated collections, continue its pause on automated notices, and keep its surge teams in place until the hiring challenges and processing backlogs are addressed. The Senator and her colleagues note in their letter that the IRS is falling short of its hiring goals and its paper return backlog has increased from this same point last year.
 
Sinema has repeatedly heard from Arizonans about the economic uncertainty the IRS backlog is creating for families. The Senator and her team have received calls and letters expressing serious concern for the IRS’s failure to meet expectations in serving responsible Arizona taxpayers. That is why Sinema is seeking answers from the IRS on these failures and how it intends to improve and better serve Arizonans.
 
In May, the IRS agreed to Sinema and her bipartisan colleagues’s call to address its backlog, reduce delays, and maximize efficiency. The IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department later announced efforts to add additional surge teams, help process the backlog, and improve customer service.

The announcement follows Sinema’s successful efforts securing $4 billion in drought resiliency funding and the launch of her Water Advisory CouncilPHOENIX – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema released a statement following the Bureau of Reclamation’s announcement of new operation conditions at Lakes Mead and Powell following continued drought conditions.
 
“Arizona’s future depends on the strength and resiliency of our water supply. As the West continues experiencing historic drought, Arizona has led the way identifying short and long term solutions while shouldering a disproportionate share of this crisis. I’m proud of our efforts securing $13 billion in drought resiliency funding over the past year, and I look forward to working with my Water Advisory Council, stakeholders from across Arizona, and leaders in our neighboring Basin States to ensure a strong and secure water future so Arizona can continue to thrive and grow,” said Sinema.
 
In today’s announcement, the Bureau of Reclamation reduced downstream releases from Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams, reducing the amount of water apportioned to Arizona by an additional 80,000 acre feet on top of 2022 reductions for a total of 529,000 acre-feet or 21% of Arizona’s Colorado River allocation. Sinema has questioned the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation about how they intend to achieve agreement between the Basin states for critical emergency conservation to ensure all states participate in securing the West’s water future. She will continue to hold the federal government accountable to ensure it is doing its part in mitigating the damages of drought.
 
Sinema recently launched her Water Advisory Council to seek feedback from water experts and stakeholders from across Arizona — including Tribal, conservation, business, and academic leaders — to develop and deliver solutions to Arizona’s ongoing drought. Members of Sinema’s Council include: Gila River Indian Community Governor Stephen Roe Lewis, Dr. Tom Buschatzke from the Arizona Department of Water Resources, Central Arizona Project General Manager Ted Cooke, Christian Stumpf of The Nature Conservancy, and Arizona State University's Kyl Center for Water Policy Director Sarah Porter.
 
Recently, Sinema secured $4 billion for drought mitigation across the American West in the Senate-passed Inflation Reduction Act. Last year, Sinema co-authored and led negotiations for the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law, which makes historic investments in drought resilience. Specifically, Sinema secured more than $8 billion to strengthen water infrastructure throughout the American West, such as drought contingency, dam safety, aging infrastructure, water storage, water recycling, and more. This funding includes $300 million over the next five years for water reclamation operations under the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan. Of this funding, $250 million is for the Bureau of Reclamation to create or conserve 100,000 acre feet of water annually for the Lower Colorado River Basin at Lake Mead.

During the briefing, Sinema shared with Yavapai County officials how the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law – which she led and passed into law – provides $8.25 billion for wildfire management, resiliency, restoration, and natural resources-related infrastructure. 
 
“We’re grateful for the Prescott Fire Center and area agencies’ work in detecting and responding to wildfires in our state. As fire season continues, we’ll keep working with leaders on the ground to protect Arizona communities and families, and ensure historic funding from our law is implemented quickly to lessen the impact of future fires,” said Sinema.
 
As Arizona experiences the most severe drought in 1,200 years, Yavapai County experts emphasized the importance of a robust wildfire prevention, mitigation, and cleanup plan for the region. 
 
Sinema’s historic infrastructure law secured for the Prescott National Forest a total of $28.7 million for forest treatment from 2022 to 2024 -- with $11.1 million coming in 2022 alone. Additionally, earlier this year, Sinema announced a $61 million investment for wildfire prevention in Arizona for 2022, directly investing in Arizona for the implementation of 4FRI as well as critical recovery and mitigation projects.
 
As part of the visit, Sinema and Yavapai County officials discussed how Arizonans rely on National Weather Service predictions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data to predict fire trajectory and determine impacts to landscapes and their families’ safety. Sinema’s bipartisan law includes $80 million for NOAA high-performance computing and $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection, and forecasting, which will help the Prescott Fire Center respond to ongoing wildfires efficiently and effectively.

“We’re working hand-in-hand with leaders across Yavapai County to ensure our bipartisan infrastructure law’s investments in wildfire mitigation and recovery, bridge and road repairs, airport improvements, and more go directly into the projects that need them,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
The roundtable follows the onset of fire season in Arizona, with the Crooks Fire burning nearly 10,000 acres south of Prescott. As Arizona experiences the most severe drought in 1,200 years, Yavapai County leaders emphasized the importance of wildfire prevention, mitigation, and cleanup for the region. 
 
Sinema shared with local leaders how her historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law authorizes a once-in-a-generation $8.25 billion for wildfire management, resiliency, restoration, and natural resources-related infrastructure. Sinema’s historic bill secured for the Prescott National Forest a total of $28.7 million for forest treatment from 2022 to 2024 -- with $11.1 million coming in 2022 alone. Additionally, earlier this year, Sinema announced a $61 million investment for wildfire prevention in Arizona for 2022, directly investing in Arizona for the implementation of 4FRI as well as critical recovery and mitigation projects.

Sinema’s bipartisan law includes $80 million for NOAA high-performance computing and $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection, and forecasting.
 
Yavapai County leaders detailed additional funding priorities for the region, including transportation expansion and securing Arizona’s water future – both areas in which Sinema’s infrastructure law makes significant investments. 
 
Specifically, Sinema secured $8.3 billion for Western Water, including $3.2 billion for the Aging Infrastructure Account and $250 million to fully fund the Drought Contingency Plan operations at Lake Mead for 5 years. In 2022 alone, Arizona will receive $109 million in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency to address clean and drinking water systems, update wastewater infrastructure, and help clean-up water contaminants like PFAS in communities across the state. In Yavapai County, Camp Verde School District and a local assisted living facility received $3 million from the Army Corps of Engineers to connect both facilities to the Yavapai-Apache Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure more reliable service.
 
On formula funding alone, Arizona expects to receive about $903 million over five years to improve public transportation options across the state, representing a roughly 32% increase over 2021 FAST Act formula transit funding levels. Sinema’s law reauthorizes Federal Transit Administration programs for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. Like the highway programs, many of the transit programs are also based on formulas and flow directly to the transit agencies, just as they have in the past. Sinema pledged to work hand-in-hand with leaders on the ground to identify grants and programs for which they qualify, ensuring Arizona communities receive every dollar they’re due.
 
In another big win for Yavapai County, Prescott Regional Airport-Ernest A. Love Field is slated to receive $5,104,440 over the next five years from the infrastructure law in repairs and upgrades improving airport safety, convenience, and efficiency for Arizonans who fly. Of the $15 billion for airport improvement projects, Arizona will receive more than $360 million for airport infrastructure over the next five years.
 
Roundtable participants included Chairwoman Mary Mallory (Yavapai County Board of Supervisors), Mayor Phil Goode (Prescott), Mayor Jack Dillenberg (Jerome), Mayor Robyn Prudehomme-Bauer (Clarkdale), Mayor Jack Miller (Chino Valley), Councilmember Tosca Henry (Cottonwood), Vincent Gallegos (Central Yavapai Metropolitan Planning Organization), and Gilbert Davidson (Prescott Valley)."

The University of Arizona’s mining and geological engineering program would be positioned to earn grants under Sinema’s bipartisan legislation.
 
“Investing in Arizona’s energy future through mining education programs will fuel jobs, clean up abandoned mines, and keep Arizona communities safe,” said Sinema.
 
“As our nation looks to maintain our economic competitiveness, including a sustainable energy infrastructure, expansion of EVs, and an increasingly connected realization of the fourth industrial revolution, it is essential that the U.S. maintains and expands domestic sources of critical minerals, including copper.  The Mining Schools Act of 2022 comes at an opportune time as the University of Arizona School of Mining and Mineral Resources is standing up in perfect alignment with this Act, working to ensure that we meet the workforce and research needs to remain global leaders,” said David Hahn, Dean of the College of Engineering, University of Arizona
 
The bipartisan Mining Schools Act authorizes a seven-year $10 million U.S. Department of Energy grant program for mining schools. These grants can be used to recruit students and research projects or demonstration projects related to the production of minerals. These programs would include critical mineral and rare earth element exploration, as well as reclamation technology. The University of Arizona’s College of Mining and Geological Engineering would be well positioned to apply for grants under the Sinema-backed legislation.
 
In 2020, the mining industry had a $15.4 billion total economic impact and supported nearly 47,700 Arizona jobs. The Sinema-backed legislation would help develop the workforce to extract the minerals needed to fuel the transition to clean energy and wider use of electric vehicles. The Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe could benefit from additional mining professionals who could help with remediation efforts at abandoned uranium mines. There are over 200,000 abandoned mine features across Arizona and only 19,000 have been identified by the Arizona State Mine Inspector.
 
Sinema’s backing of the Mining Schools Act complements her work cleaning up abandoned mines in Arizona. In March, Sinema cosponsored the bipartisan Good Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act– legislation that cuts red tape, allowing organizations ensure safer Arizona communities by cleaning up abandoned mines, which can contaminate water, cause environmental damage, and contain old explosives."

Sinema honed in on implementation of her Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law’s historic funding in three key areas: highway, aviation, and transit – each of particular relevance to the Department of Transportation. 
 
Specifically, Sinema identified the expansion of Arizona’s Interstate-10 on the 26 miles that the highway passes through lands belonging to the Gila River Indian Community as a priority project for the state, citing severe congestion and delays for motorists. Buttigieg shared with Sinema his approach to distributing this type of funding, and gave his commitment to distribute highway funding consistent with provisions in Sinema’s law.
 
Under Sinema’s historic infrastructure law, Arizona airports are expected to receive $348 million for crucial upgrades over the next five years. Last November, Sinema hosted Buttigieg at Phoenix Sky Harbor to see firsthand the kinds of improvements Sinema’s infrastructure law will make in passenger convenience, safety, and experience. During the hearing, Buttigieg provided a detailed update on the status of aviation infrastructure programs, like the airport terminal and air traffic control programs. 
 
During the hearing, Sinema and Buttigieg underscored the importance of her bipartisan infrastructure law’s increased investment in public transit in communities of all sizes across Arizona, and her role in advancing a provision in the bipartisan infrastructure law that specifically benefits transit projects in Arizona cities with fewer than 200,000 residents, such as Flagstaff and Yuma.
 
Sinema has been holding regular meetings with local and Tribal leaders across Arizona about the implementation of her bipartisan infrastructure law. Recently, Sinema toured Southern Arizona highlighting her work to ensure local and tribal communities get their fair share of funds from Sinema’s infrastructure law.

“Yesterday, this committee heard from Secretary Mayorkas regarding the DHS plan for handling the expected influx of migrants. I have not yet seen evidence that Arizona has received sufficient resources to manage an end to Title 42. Promises and platitudes are not enough. In order to meet this moment, DHS needs to put the necessary resources on the ground and implement processing system improvements in a manner that will keep Arizona communities safe, and treat migrants fairly and humanely,” said Sinema, Chair of the Senate Border Management Subcommittee and member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.
 
During the hearing, Sinema indicated she remains concerned DHS will not be able to procure sufficient resources by the Administration’s self-imposed Title 42 termination deadline given the ongoing staffing and resource shortages. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) daily transportation capacity, according to a memorandum, should now be 9,000 individuals – still well below the anticipated maximum daily arrivals rate of 18,000 migrants.
 
Sinema underscored how robust migrant processing at ports of entry is a key part of the DHS plan for the Southern Border. However, Sinema noted, Arizona’s ports of entry were not designed to manage large-scale asylum processing, creating potentially volatile situations that are unsafe for CBP officers and migrants.
 
During yesterday’s hearing, the Homeland Security Secretary expressed support for Sinema’s recently-introduced Bipartisan Border Solutions Act with Republican Senator John Cornyn (Texas) that improves the federal government’s response to the border crisis, reduces the impact on local border communities, ensures migrants are treated fairly and humanely, and improves management and security along the border.
 
Sinema recently cosponsored the bipartisan Securing America’s Ports of Entry Act – legislation that boosts the number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel at ports of entry, increasing border security while facilitating legal trade and travel.
 
Partnering with a bipartisan group of senators, Sinema recently introduced legislation that ensures the Administration coordinates and communicates with border communities and puts a comprehensive, workable plan in place before lifting Title 42."

Sinema’s bipartisan resolution calls for greater efforts to help advance treatment, caregiving, and general care options for brain cancers – honoring the legacy of the late Arizona senior Senator John McCain.
 
“Our bipartisan resolution honoring John McCain and other Americans who have battled glioblastoma will strengthen efforts towards finding new treatments for this disease and other brain cancers,” said Sinema.
 
Sinema’s bipartisan legislation calls for treatments of glioblastoma and related brain cancers to slow its progression, improve quality of life, and recognize the importance of molecular biomarker testing to improve diagnosis and treatment.
 
In January, Sinema led the entire bipartisan Arizona congressional delegation supporting University of Arizona’s Cancer Center application renewal of its National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant. Researchers at the University have led groundbreaking research in searching for genetic differences between glioblastoma cells from long- and short-term survivors.
 
In 2020, the National Cancer Institute established the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network to enhance and support the discovery and development of glioblastoma therapies. Sinema’s resolution calls for continued federal investments into the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-kelly-ohalleran-introduce-hualapai-tribe-water-rights-settlement-act,"Legislation will deliver Hualapai Tribe’s water agreement of approximately 4,000 acre-feet per yearWASHINGTON – Arizona Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly and Congressman Tom O’Halleran (AZ-01) introduced the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act – legislation ratifying the Hualapai Tribe’s Colorado River water settlement agreement, which will deliver approximately 4,000 acre-feet of water per year to the Tribe.
 
“We’re working to ensure the Hualapai Tribe’s economic and water security by delivering the Tribe’s water rights agreement which will help strengthen water systems, secure the tribe’s water future, and create jobs,” said Sinema.
 
“In Arizona, water access is critical for continued economic growth and job creation,” said Kelly. “As we navigate a historic drought, our bill will provide long-term water security to Hualapai members and deliver water to the Grand Canyon Skywalk, a major tourist attraction located in the Hualapai community.”“I’m proud to join Senators Sinema and Kelly to introduce an update to the Hualapai Water Rights Settlement that takes into account tribal sovereignty, the protection of our most precious natural resource, and the growing communities of Peach Springs and Grand Canyon West. As a champion of this legislation for the past several years, I strongly support this commonsense fix and look forward to work with my Arizona delegation colleagues to get this over the finish line,” said O’Halleran.
 
“The Hualapai Tribe has been working for more than 12 years with the State of Arizona and other State parties, and with the Department of the Interior, to secure our water rights,” said Tribal Chairman Dr. Damon R. Clarke. “The Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2022, when enacted, will provide Colorado River water that will serve the critical needs of our present and future tribal population and provide for economic opportunities on our Reservation.  Enactment of this legislation is vital to our future.”
 
The Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act would approve Hualapai Tribe’s water rights claims, as well as other allotees in Arizona, and authorize construction of a water project related to the water rights claims – delivering 4,000-acre feet of water per year.
 
This legislation establishes the Hualapai Water Trust Fund Account and the Hualapai Water Settlement Implementation Fund Account, with $180 million and $5 million respectively authorized until expended. These accounts are for construction, operations and maintenance, technical assistance costs, and environmental compliance costs associated with the pipeline from the Colorado River.
 
The Hualapai Tribe has been working for a decade to secure an agreement with the U.S. Departments of State and Interior, and this legislation from Sinema, Kelly, and O’Halleran represents a strong step to deliver Hualapai Tribe’s water agreement.
 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law that Sinema led, Kelly helped shape, and O’Halleran helped pass fully funds all currently-authorized Indian Water Rights Settlements.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-daines-bipartisan-bill-boosts-arizonas-recreational-tourism-industry-protects-jobs,"WASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) introduced bipartisan legislation boosting Arizona’s outdoor recreational tourism industry and protecting jobs by making it easier for Arizona’s outdoor recreational outfitting and guiding services industry to hold multi-day tours and reduce operational costs.
 
“We’re boosting Arizona’s outdoor recreational tourism industry, fueling job creation, and expanding recreational opportunities across our state,” said Sinema.
 
“Thanks to Montana’s outfitters and guides, folks from all over the world come to Montana to hunt, fish and explore our great outdoors, and as a result, Montana’s outdoor economy is thriving,” said Daines. “It’s critical we pass my bipartisan bill to help protect Montana sportsmen jobs by cutting burdensome red tape that limits Montana workers and adds unnecessary burdens to Montana small business owners.”
 
“This bipartisan legislation could not come at a more important time for the general public who relies entirely on the professional services of the recreational outfitting and guiding community throughout the country. Inflation and costs are skyrocketing in nearly every aspect of our lives, especially to participate in seasonal recreational activities. Preserving access to the outdoors and keeping it affordable for everyone is essential. This bipartisan bill will help do just that.  It will also preserve jobs, support small businesses, and benefit rural communities. We are so thankful for the bipartisan leadership on both sides of Capitol Hill for making this possible,” said John Dillon, Executive Director of Grand Canyon River Outfitters Association.
 
The bipartisan legislation exempts outfitters and guides from burdensome overtime hour requirements. These requirements increase the costs of multiday trips and force outfitting companies to replace guides halfway through the trip whey they reach the 40-hour limit. When it is not practical to replace guides, companies may opt not to offer as many multi-day trips, negatively impacting Arizona’s tourism economy, especially in Northern Arizona.
 
Most guides work part-time during the summer season and are paid a daily rate and work several days in a row. Rules revolving around a traditional 40-hour work week do not appropriately fit the unique circumstances of backcountry guides. Sinema’s bipartisan legislation addresses this issue and makes outdoor recreational outfitters on par with similar industries, such as ski and seasonal amusement or recreation locations.
 
This Congress, Sinema cosponsored the bipartisan Simplifying Outdoor Access for Recreation (SOAR) Act – legislation that streamlines and improves the permitting process for outfitters, educational organizations, and community groups to enjoy Arizona’s public lands.
 
Arizona’s outdoor recreation is a $21.2 billion industry, producing $1.4 billion annually in state and local revenue. Many of the 201,000 Arizona jobs supported by the outdoor economy are in rural communities, where they often have significant economic impact."
https://www.sinema.senate.gov/breaking-senate-advances-sinema-backed-bipartisan-semiconductor-manufacturing-bill-lowers-prices,"The COMPETES Act – bipartisan bill shaped by Sinema addressing supply chain issues and inflation and restores America’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing – advances to the Conference Committee for final negotiations between both chambers of CongressWASHINGTON – Following calls from Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema to pass into law the bipartisan COMPETES Act – both chambers of Congress advanced the legislation to Conference Committee – a critical step in getting the bipartisan bill signed into law. Once the bicameral and bipartisan Conference Committee finishes its work, the U.S. House and Senate will vote on final passage and then send the legislation to the President’s desk to be signed into law.
 
“Today’s critical step on our bipartisan semiconductor manufacturing bill represents the strength of this legislation that will create jobs, tackle current supply chain challenges, and lower prices for Arizonans by enhancing America’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing,” said Sinema.
 
The Sinema-backed bipartisan COMPETES Act would invest $52 billion in Sinema’s CHIPS For America grants that will support Arizona’s domestic semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on foreign countries.
 
During a Senate hearing, Sinema underscored how semiconductors are essential for both the economic and national security of the United States. Semiconductors are necessary technologies Americans rely on every day – such as phones, cars, and computers – and are also a key resource for America’s military. The pandemic showed how the chip shortage directly impacted everyday families across the country by increasing prices on goods that include semiconductors.
 
Sinema highlighted Arizona as an example of the positive impact semiconductor legislation has on the economy. Sinema’s CHIPS For America Act fueled Intel’s $20 billion expansion in Arizona, creating thousands of jobs in the state. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has started construction of a $35 billion advanced manufacturing site in Arizona which will create thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs for Arizonans.

“The Department has a wide range of tools to assist with many important Arizona priorities, such as addressing the historic drought in the Southwest, increasing domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, and expanding broadband to all corners of our state. I look forward to working with you and with my colleagues on this committee to continue to advance these efforts in a bipartisan manner to help Arizona families,” said Sinema, a member of the Senate Commerce Committee.
 
Sinema focused her discussion with the Commerce Secretary on key issues currently impacting Arizona families and focusing on bipartisan solutions that can address drought and wildfire mitigation, inflation, and semiconductor manufacturing. The Senator also encouraged the Commerce Secretary to continue bipartisan efforts and use available tools within the Commerce Department to address the supply chain crisis, support Arizona business growth, and create good-paying jobs.
 
During the hearing, Sinema noted the Tunnel Fire north of Flagstaff, which has burned over 20,000 acres, and the Crooks Fire, which has burned over 6,000 acres south of Prescott. Sinema underscored how Arizonans rely on National Weather Service predictions and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data to predict fire trajectory and determine impacts to landscapes and their families’ safety. Sinema’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law included $80 million for NOAA high-performance computing and $50 million for wildfire prediction, detection, and forecasting.
 
Sinema additionally discussed her bipartisan CHIPS for America Act – which was signed into law last year – which will help restore America’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, an issue critical for America’s economic and national security, and helps combat inflation. Sinema noted that the bipartisan CHIPS for America Act fueled Intel’s $20 billion expansion in Arizona, creating thousands of jobs in the state. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) began construction of a $35 billion advanced manufacturing site in Arizona, which will create thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs for Arizonans.
 
With projects already underway in Arizona, Sinema’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law ensures Arizona’s economy continues to thrive making historic investments to strengthen broadband, airports, wildfire mitigation, water systems and drought resilience, electricity and power grids, natural resources and energy production, and Land Ports of Entry – all without raising taxes on everyday Arizonans.

“Arizona’s rural health care organizations are lifelines for underserved communities, and today’s funding will provide the needed resources, staffing, and supplies to keep Arizonans healthy and safe,” said Senator Sinema.
 
“The pandemic shed light on the key role our rural health care organizations play in keeping Arizonans healthy and safe. As our state continues to grow, we’ll keep fighting to make sure Arizonans have access to affordable and reliable care regardless of their zip code,” said Senator Kelly.
 
The over $5.1 million in grants will help rural hospitals and health care providers implement telehealth and nutrition assistance programs, increase staffing, build or renovate facilities, and purchase medical supplies.
 
Sinema and Kelly continue to press the federal government for robust support to rural Arizona community health centers. In April, Sinema and Kelly urged congressional leaders to reach an agreement on critical COVID-19 health aid for vulnerable, uninsured Arizonans and health providers in the state. In their letter, Sinema and Kelly note that with potential new COVID-19 variants looming, Arizona’s rural providers will be unable to afford the needed nursing staff to care for their at-risk communities, many of whom are unable to care for those medically-underserved including agricultural, older, and tribal populations.

In 2020, the National Cancer Institute established the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network to enhance and support the discovery and development of glioblastoma therapies. Sinema’s resolution calls for continued federal investments into the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network."
https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-celebrates-historic-funding-winslow-levee-project-winslow-tribal-leaders,"Senator successfully secured full funding of the Winslow Levee Project in her bipartisan infrastructure law, safeguarding Arizona families, communities, and jobsWINSLOW – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema joined Winslow Mayor Birdie Cano, local leaders, and community members to visit the Winslow Levee and discuss her work securing full funding for the project – a top priority for the region – in her historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law. The new Winslow Levee will protect the town of Winslow and surrounding communities from flooding that harms hard working Arizona families and that has the potential to disrupt supply chains throughout the country.
 
“I’m so glad investments from our infrastructure law will protect Arizonans from dangerous flooding and other environmental disasters by fully funding the construction of the Winslow Levee Project. This is a big deal for Winslow – and I’ll keep working with local and tribal leaders across Arizona to ensure they have the resources needed for their communities to thrive,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
During the discussion, Navajo County leaders commended Sinema’s leadership on behalf of rural communities throughout bipartisan negotiations that resulted in this historic investment.
 
In January, Sinema worked directly with the Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young to prioritize and secure full funding for the construction of the Little Colorado River Flood Control (Winslow Levee) project in the Army Corps’ 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs spend plan. Later that month, Sinema announced that her advocacy resulted in a historic $82.8 million for Arizona water systems and environmental infrastructure in 2022, $65.75 million of which would be used to fund the entire Winslow Levee Project.
 
The Winslow Levee has been decertified since 2008 and is a danger to the surrounding communities – particularly nearby Navajo and underserved communities – and a key rail line that moves billions of dollars of goods through Arizona each year. With historic funding from Sinema’s infrastructure law, the Winslow Levee will protect the town of Winslow against flooding that could harm Arizona families and Arizona jobs, and disrupt supply chains through the country. 
 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law invests $8.3 billion in building and strengthening water infrastructure throughout the American West, including for aging infrastructure, water storage and conveyance, water recycling and reuse, desalination, drought contingency plans, and dam safety.
 
Last month, Sinema and Senator Mark Kelly (Ariz.) announced an additional $500,000 from the Fiscal Year 2022 budget legislation to cover planning, engineering, and design costs for the Winslow Levee project.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-introduces-bipartisan-bill-supporting-arizona-businesses-creating-jobs,"Sinema’s bill helps identify solutions to cut costs for small and medium-sized businesses looking to go publicWASHINGTON –Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.) introduced the bipartisan Middle Market IPO Underwriting Cost Act—legislation boosting small and medium-sized Arizona businesses by helping reduce the costs incurred when they conduct an initial public offering (IPO) and “go public,” trading a company’s stock on a stock exchange.
 
“Our commonsense, bipartisan bill boosts Arizona businesses by making it easier to grow and create jobs. By going public, Arizona businesses will be able to give everyday Arizona families the opportunity to invest directly in their businesses and build wealth for the future. We’ll continue working across the aisle to fuel economic opportunities across our state,” said Senator Sinema. 
 
“We need to bring our financial sector into the 21st century, and that means looking at new, innovative ways to do things like initial public offerings,” Senator Lummis said. “Big companies figured out years ago that they could reduce costs by changing IPO fee structures. Wyoming is full of small and mid-sized companies and they should not be penalized simply because of historic fee structures and restrictions on how IPOs are funded. I am honored to work with Senator Sinema on this important legislation.”
 
Sinema’s Middle Market IPO Underwriting Cost Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a report on the direct and indirect costs of a traditional IPO and compare those costs with the cost of obtaining alternate forms of financing. The SEC would also have to report on recent trends in IPO offerings, and the costs incurred.

“César Chávez began his legacy of service in Yuma – and spent his life championing everyday families and fighting for worker’s rights across the United States. Our resolution celebrates his incredible accomplishments,” said Sinema.
 
César Chávez was born on March 31, 1927 in Yuma, Arizona. Sinema’s resolution designates March 31 as “César Chávez Day” and encourages Americans to observe the day of recognition with service, community, and education programs in celebration of Chávez’s legacy. 
 
The Senate resolution asserts that the United States should continue the efforts of César Chávez to ensure equality, justice, and dignity for all Americans, and pledges to promote his legacy.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-kelly-bipartisan-group-senators-introduce-bill-delaying-end-title-42-ensuring-coordination,"Senators’ bipartisan bill ensures the Administration works with Arizona border communities and puts a comprehensive plan in place before lifting Title 42
Legislation delays the Administration’s end of Title 42 for at least 60 days WASHINGTON – Arizona Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly and a bipartisan group of Senators introduced legislation ensuring the Administration coordinates and communicates with border communities and puts a comprehensive, workable plan in place before lifting Title 42. The bill specifically delays the Administration’s planned end to Title 42 for at least 60 days.
 
“Arizona communities bear the brunt of the federal government’s failure at our border, so we’re stepping in and protecting border communities by ensuring the Administration works hand-in-hand with local leaders, law enforcement, and non-profits to put a comprehensive, workable plan in place before lifting Title 42. I’ll continue pushing for transparency and accountability from the Administration to help secure the border, keep Arizona communities safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely,” said Senator Sinema, Chair of the Border Management Subcommittee.“The Biden administration was wrong to set an end date for Title 42 without a comprehensive plan in place. It’s why today we are introducing bipartisan legislation requiring this administration to implement a plan before lifting Title 42 that protects the public health and safety of our border communities and migrants. We need a secure, orderly, and humane response at our southern border and our bipartisan legislation holds the Biden administration accountable to that,” said Senator Mark Kelly. 
 
The Senators’ bill – introduced with Senators James Lankford (R-OK), John Cornyn (R-TX), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and John Thune (R-SD) – prevents the Administration from ending the Title 42 emergency authority until at least 60 days after ending the COVID-19 national emergency declaration. After the end of the national emergency, the Department of Homeland Security would have thirty days to submit to Congress a plan to address the impacts of the post-Title 42 migrant influx.
 
Last week, Sinema and Senator Mark Kelly spoke with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to discuss the Administration’s Title 42 contingency plans. Both senators underscored how Arizona communities and migrants could be harmed if a Title 42 end is not accompanied by proper planning, coordination, and resources. Sinema also raised concerns she heard from her recent virtual border roundtable with federal and non-governmental partners in Arizona, and other conversations she has had with Arizona DHS officials. Sinema called for DHS to launch an intergovernmental coordination effort to ensure communication between federal, state, local, and non-governmental partners to strengthen cooperation. Secretary Mayorkas agreed to move forward with that strategy across the country. Kelly emphasized the need for proactive engagement and clear communications between the Department of Homeland Security, Congressional offices, local officials, sheriffs, and local governments. He also asked Secretary Mayorkas for details on how the increased funding Sinema and Kelly secured in the omnibus for border management and security will be used, especially as Title 42 is lifted.
 
Recently, Sinema and Kelly sent a letter to President Biden expressing concerns that an abrupt end to Title 42 enforcement without a comprehensive response plan in place could harm Arizona communities and migrants and greatly increase the strain on the Department of Homeland Security, and local nonprofits that are already near or at capacity due to the current border crisis. Sinema and Kelly’s letter states that Title 42 authority should not be used indefinitely, but points out that migrants and Arizona communities could be harmed if an ending to Title 42 is not accompanied by proper planning, coordination, and resources. 
 
Last June, Sinema and Kelly asked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to proactively create a comprehensive plan in advance of an end to Title 42 and requested to be briefed on this plan. In their most recent letter, the Senators say they have not seen evidence that DHS has developed and implemented a sufficient plan. Recently, Sinema and Kelly secured critical federal funding to help Arizona manage the current migrant crisis, improve border security, and keep Arizona communities safe.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-backs-increased-financial-punishments-against-russia,"Today, the Senate approved banning Russian oil and gas imports to the U.S. and stripping Russia of its preferred trade statusWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema applauded the Senate’s action banning Russian oil and gas imports to the U.S and stripping Russia of its preferred trade status, which places increased tariffs on imported Russian goods. 
 
“Today’s bipartisan Congressional action sends a clear message that the American people will not subsidize Putin’s illegal and unprovoked war. As Russia’s attacks continue on a free and democratic Ukraine, we must keep providing military and humanitarian support to Ukrainians, increase financial punishments on Putin and his regime, and boost our cyber defense against Russian threats. I stand ready to support policies that keep America safe, promote our country’s and our allies’ long-term security, and ensure our servicemembers’ safety,” said Sinema.
 
Earlier this week, the Senate passed the Sinema-backed Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, led by Senator Cornyn (R-TX). This legislation increases the Administration’s capability to more quickly transfer military equipment to Ukraine, ensuring they have the tools to defend themselves. 
 
Sinema is also an original cosponsor of a Resolution honoring the women of Ukraine who have contributed to the fight for freedom.
 
Sinema has helped secure critical resources supporting Ukraine including: 
As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Sinema has also secured and additional $161 million for FinCEN and $195 million for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, modernizing outdated IT infrastructure and boosting staffing to increase sanctions enforcement against the Russian Federation and others.
 
In the Ukraine Supplemental legislation recently passed into law, Sinema also helped advance emergency food assistance, health care, and other urgent support through the USAID International Disaster Assistance program; funding for the European Command operations mission, personnel, and intelligence support; key economic assistance to respond to energy and cybersecurity needs; and an increase to the President’s current authority to transfer defense equipment to Ukraine and other allies."

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-convenes-community-health-centers-virtual-roundtable,"Senator brought together community health center leaders and staff to further partnership advancing affordable health care solutions for ArizonansWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema convened a virtual roundtable with community health center leaders and staff from across Arizona to discuss solutions to the continued needs centers face with COVID-19 testing, treating, vaccinating, and beyond. 
 
“Throughout the pandemic, Arizona’s community health centers worked to keep tribal communities safe, ensure our rural areas weren’t left behind, and checked in on vulnerable families and seniors in need of help. Today’s meeting provided another opportunity to hear more about the challenges they are seeing on the ground, how we can continue working together to address those difficulties, and help Arizonans return to normal and thrive,” said Sinema.
 
Community health centers are essential primary care and safety net providers serving Arizona’s most vulnerable populations – including seniors, families, migrants and asylum seekers, rural communities, tribal members, and other underserved Arizonans. Sinema worked with the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers to host the virtual roundtable and learn more about health centers’ needs in providing affordable health care to the communities they serve.
 
During the meeting, Sinema emphasized her efforts in leading members of the Arizona congressional delegation last week in urging the passage of sufficient COVID supplemental funding to meet the immediate needs of Arizona providers. In the letter, Sinema and members of the delegation advocated for additional support for providers testing, treating, and vaccinating Arizona’s most vulnerable populations. The letter acknowledged how Arizona’s safety net providers continue to struggle with insufficient resources and high levels of need – directly informed by the advocacy of community health centers participating in the virtual roundtable. 
 
Participants at the virtual roundtable featured community health center leaders and staff from health centers across Arizona – including North Country Healthcare (Flagstaff), Valleywise Health (Phoenix), Wesley Community and Health Centers (Phoenix), Valle del Sol (Phoenix), Canyonlands Healthcare (Page), MHC Healthcare (Marana), Sunset Community Health Center (Yuma), Mariposa Community Health Center (Nogales), Sun Life Family Health Center (Casa Grande), Creek Valley Health Center (Colorado City), Native Americans for Community Action, Inc. (Flagstaff) and more.
 
Sinema has partnered with the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers during her time in Congress and throughout the pandemic in securing aid and resources for Arizona, especially for vulnerable communities. 
 
Sinema recently cosponsored the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act—bipartisan legislation introduced by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Republican Senator John Cornyn (Texas) that allows unused visas from prior years to be used by doctors and nurses who can help combat the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the ongoing health care staffing challenges in Arizona and across the country.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/expanding-federal-job-opportunities-arizonans-sinema-introduces-bipartisan-chance-compete-act,"Senator’s bipartisan bill makes federal hiring more efficient and federal government more effective by updating federal hiring processWASHINGTON – Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema introduced the bipartisan Chance to Compete Act with Republican Senators Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) and James Lankford (Okla.) to make federal job hiring fairer for Arizonans by reducing traditional bureaucratic barriers that limit opportunities for federal job seekers.  
 
“We’re making federal hiring more efficient and the federal government more effective by removing barriers and expanding opportunities for skilled Arizonans who have the knowledge and experience to work in the federal government, even if they don’t have a traditional college degree,” said Senator Sinema, Chair of the Senate’s Government Operations Subcommittee.
 
“For too long, the federal government’s hiring priorities have focused on college degrees and institutions instead of if the individual is actually qualified,” Senator Hagerty said. “Federal workers should be hired based on skills, not just if they have a degree. I’m pleased to have Senator Sinema’s partnership as we seek to modernize our federal workforce, which taxpayers depend on.”
 
Sinema’s bipartisan legislation helps eliminate long-time challenges that often prevent skilled workers from getting federal jobs. Instead of relying on subjective self-evaluations, key-word search resume reviews, and binary credentials for positions, federal agencies will be required to use actual job evaluations and tests to determine if applicants can do the job. Sinema’s bipartisan Chance to Compete Act expands job opportunities and possibilities for Arizonans who have the ability and skill to perform these jobs but might not have traditional requirements such as a college degree.
 
The bill also allows agencies to more easily share information about job candidates when they are working to fill similar positions. This will decrease time to hire for all applicants, making the federal hiring process more efficient and effective. The bill also takes steps to increase federal hiring transparency and improve federal Human Resource Departments.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/45-million-investment-coming-arizona-bridges-bipartisan-infrastructure-law,"Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law led by Sinema and shaped by Kelly provides Arizona $45 million for needed bridge repairs and replacementsWASHINGTON - $45 million will be invested in Arizona bridges this year from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law led by Senator Kyrsten Sinema and shaped by Senator Mark Kelly.
 
The historic funding, which will total $225 million over five years, will help Arizona repair and replace over 130 bridges in poor condition across the state.
 
“Our bipartisan legislation directly invests in Arizona through long-overdue repairs to bridges across our state, creating jobs and keeping Arizonans safe as they travel to school, commute to work, visit loved ones, and more,” said Sinema, co-author and lead negotiator of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law.
 
“Bridges connect goods, services, and families to one another all across our state. Repairing Arizona’s bridges that need upgrades is not just an economic issue – it’s a safety issue, as well. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Arizona communities and tribes will soon be able to fix the bridges that serve their communities,” said Senator Kelly.
 
Sinema led bipartisan Senate negotiations with Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio that included Senator Kelly and senators from both parties.
 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law authorizes the largest investment in American bridges – dedicating $26.5 billion in new funding to states over the next five years of and $825 million for Tribal transportation facilities. Today’s announcement will total $5.3 billion to states and $165 million for tribal transportation facilities for this year. Today’s funding follows previously announced $969 million for Arizona highways, roads, and bridges over five years. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law also makes Arizona bridges eligible to compete for $12.5 billion in competitive grants to improve the condition of bridges. Kelly, who serves on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, championed the inclusion of this program within the Surface Transportation Act of 2021, which was included in the final infrastructure law.
 
The bipartisan infrastructure law was supported by groups including The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, The National Association of Manufacturers, The AFL-CIO, The National Retail Federation, The Bipartisan Policy Center, North America’s Building Trades Unions, The Outdoor Industry Association, The American Hotel and Lodging Association, The National Education Association, as well as hundreds of mayors across all 50 states.

For an MP3 soundbite, click HERE.WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) delivered remarks on the floor of the Senate today on voting rights, America’s divisions, and the work and role of the U.S. Senate.
 
In part:
 
… We are divided. It is more likely today that we look at other Americans who have different views and see the “other,” or even see them as enemies – instead of as fellow countrymen and women who share our core values. It’s more common today to demonize someone who thinks differently than us, rather than to seek to understand their views. Our politics reflect and exacerbate these divisions, making it more and more difficult to find lasting, broadly supported solutions to safeguard our freedoms, keep our country safe, and expand opportunity for all our citizens. So two questions face us as a nation: Where does this descending spiral of division lead? And how can we stop it?... 
 
… Our country’s divisions have now fueled efforts in several states that will make it more difficult for Americans to vote and undermine faith that all Americans should have in our elections and our democracy. These state laws have no place in a nation whose government is formed by free, fair, and open elections. We must also acknowledge a painful fact: The state laws we seek to address are symptoms of a larger, more deeply-rooted problem facing our democracy – the divisions themselves, which have hardened in recent years, and have combined with rampant disinformation to push too many Americans away from our basic Constitutional values… I share the concerns of civil rights advocates and others I have heard from in recent months about these state laws. I strongly support those efforts to contest these laws in court, and to invest significant resources into these states to better organize and stop efforts to restrict access at the ballot box. And I strongly support and will continue to vote for legislative responses to address these state laws – including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, that the Senate is currently considering. I support these bills because they strengthen Americans’ access to the ballot box and they better ensure that Americans’ votes are counted fairly…
 
… These bills help treat the symptoms of the disease – but they do not fully address the disease itself. And while I continue to support these bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country… There is no need for me to restate my long-standing support for the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation. There’s no need for me to restate its role protecting our country from wild reversals in federal policy. It is a view I have held during my years serving in both the U.S. House and the Senate, and it is the view I continue to hold. It is the belief that I have shared many times in public settings and in private settings. Senators of both parties have offered ideas – including some that would earn my support – to make this body more productive, more deliberative, more responsive to Americans’ needs, and a place of genuine debate about our country’s pressing issues. And while this week’s harried discussions about Senate rules are but a poor substitute for what I believe could have – and should have – been a thoughtful public debate at any time over the past year, such a discussion is still a worthy goal… 
 
… American politics are cyclical and the granting of power in Washington, D.C. is exchanged regularly by the voters from one party to another. This shift of power back and forth means the Senate’s 60-vote threshold has proved maddening to members of both political parties in recent years – viewed either as a weapon of obstruction, or a safety net to save the country from radical policies, depending on whether you serve in the majority or the minority. But what is the legislative filibuster other than a tool that requires new federal policy to be broadly supported by Senators representing a broader cross-section of Americans – a guardrail, inevitably viewed as an obstacle by whoever holds the Senate majority, but which in reality ensures that millions of Americans represented by the minority party have a voice in the process? Demands to eliminate this threshold (from whichever party holds the fleeting majority) amount to a group of people separated on two sides of a canyon, shouting to their colleagues that the solution to their shared challenges is to make that rift both wider and deeper…
 
… The impact is clear for all to see – the steady escalation of tit-for-tat, in which each new majority weakens the guardrails of the Senate and excludes input from the other party, furthering resentment and anger amongst this body and our constituents at home. Democrats’ increased use of requiring cloture for judicial nominees under President George W. Bush led to similar tactics by Republicans under President Barack Obama. The 2013 decision by Senate Democrats to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most judicial and presidential nominations led directly to a response in 2017 by Senate Republicans, who eliminated the threshold for Supreme Court nominees. These short-sighted actions by both parties have led to our current American Judiciary and Supreme Court, which, as I stand here today, is considering questions regarding fundamental rights Americans have enjoyed for decades… 
 
… when one party needs only negotiate within itself, policy will inextricably be pushed from the middle toward the extremes. I understand there are some on both sides of the aisle who prefer that outcome, but I do not. I know that Arizonans do not either…
 
… I share the disappointment of many that we have not found more support on the other side of the aisle for legislative responses to state-level voting restrictions. I wish that were not the case – just as I wish there had been a more serious effort on the part of Democratic Party leaders to sit down with the other party and genuinely discuss how to re-forge common ground on these issues. My Republican colleagues have a duty to meet their shared responsibility to protect access to voting and the integrity of our electoral process. We need a sustained, robust effort to defend American democracy – an effort on the part of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and all Americans in communities across this country… We should invest heavily in recruiting and supporting state and local candidates for office – in both parties – who represent the values enshrined in our Constitution. We should ensure we have a Judiciary that is less lopsided in its political leanings, and that we can all depend on to uphold the Constitution. We must confront and combat the rise of rampant disinformation and ensure that all Americans have the tools to see fact from fiction. This will be particularly difficult work, since some in power have used disinformation to manipulate our differences and pull Americans apart, pressuring us to see our fellow Americans as enemies. The dangers facing our democracy took years to metastasize. And they will take years of sustained, focused effort to effectively reverse…

Thank you.
 
I rise at a challenging and divisive time for our nation.
 
For years, America’s politics have spiraled steadily downward into increasingly bitter, tribal partisanship – and our democracy has been strained.
 
While that may sound abstract, it is a problem that hurts Americans in real, tangible ways.
 
These deepening divisions hurt our ability to work together to create new job opportunities, protect the health and safety of our communities and country, and to ensure everyday families get ahead.
 
Americans across the country know this. They see it every day – not only on social media and cable news, but at their jobs and around their dinner tables.
 
We are divided. 
 
It is more likely today that we look at other Americans who have different views and see the “other,” or even see them as enemies – instead of as fellow countrymen and women who share our core values.
 
It’s more common today to demonize someone who thinks differently than us, rather than to seek to understand their views.
 
Our politics reflect and exacerbate these divisions, making it more and more difficult to find lasting, broadly supported solutions to safeguard our freedoms, keep our country safe, and expand opportunity for all our citizens.
 
So two questions face us as a nation:
 
Where does this descending spiral of division lead? And how can we stop it?
 
Our country’s divisions have now fueled efforts in several states that will make it more difficult for Americans to vote and undermine faith that all Americans should have in our elections and our democracy.
 
These state laws have no place in a nation whose government is formed by free, fair, and open elections. 
 
We must also acknowledge a painful fact: 
 
The state laws we seek to address are symptoms of a larger, more deeply-rooted problem facing our democracy – the divisions themselves, which have hardened in recent years, and have combined with rampant disinformation to push too many Americans away from our basic Constitutional values.
 
In the Spring of 2017, after Trump took office, I wrote an opinion piece in the Arizona Republic highlighting my concerns about the strains on our Constitutional boundaries and the shrinking respect for our founding Constitutional principles. 
 
In the years that followed, my colleagues and I in this body were called upon to participate in two separate impeachment trials for crimes against our Constitution.
 
And on January 6, last year, I was standing in this very spot, speaking in this very chamber, defending Arizona’s fair and valid election against disinformation when violent insurrectionists halted the presidential certification.
 
Threats to American democracy are real.
 
I share the concerns of civil rights advocates and others I have heard from in recent months about these state laws. 
 
I strongly support those efforts to contest these laws in court, and to invest significant resources into these states to better organize and stop efforts to restrict access at the ballot box. 
 
And I strongly support and will continue to vote for legislative responses to address these state laws – including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, that the Senate is currently considering. 
 
I support these bills because they strengthen Americans’ access to the ballot box and they better ensure that Americans’ votes are counted fairly – it is through elections that Americans make their voices heard, select their representatives, and guide the future of our country and our communities.
 
These bills help treat the symptoms of the disease – but they do not fully address the disease itself.
 
And while I continue to support these bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country.
 
The debate over the Senate’s 60-vote threshold shines a light on our broader challenges.
 
There is no need for me to restate my long-standing support for the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation. There’s no need for me to restate its role protecting our country from wild reversals in federal policy. 
 
It is a view I have held during my years serving in both the U.S. House and the Senate, and it is the view I continue to hold. 
 
It is the belief that I have shared many times in public settings and in private settings.
 
Senators of both parties have offered ideas – including some that would earn my support – to make this body more productive, more deliberative, more responsive to Americans’ needs, and a place of genuine debate about our country’s pressing issues.
 
And while this week’s harried discussions about Senate rules are but a poor substitute for what I believe could have – and should have – been a thoughtful public debate at any time over the past year, such a discussion is still a worthy goal. 
 
But a discussion of rules falls short of what is required.
 
American politics are cyclical and the granting of power in Washington, D.C. is exchanged regularly by the voters from one party to another.
 
This shift of power back and forth means the Senate’s 60-vote threshold has proved maddening to members of both political parties in recent years – viewed either as a weapon of obstruction, or a safety net to save the country from radical policies, depending on whether you serve in the majority or the minority.
 
But what is the legislative filibuster other than a tool that requires new federal policy to be broadly supported by Senators representing a broader cross-section of Americans – a guardrail, inevitably viewed as an obstacle by whoever holds the Senate majority, but which in reality ensures that millions of Americans represented by the minority party have a voice in the process?
 
Demands to eliminate this threshold (from whichever party holds the fleeting majority) amount to a group of people separated on two sides of a canyon, shouting to their colleagues that the solution to their shared challenges is to make that rift both wider and deeper.
 
Consider this: in recent years, nearly every party-line response to the problems we face in this body, every partisan action taken to protect a cherished value, has led us to more division, not less. 
 
The impact is clear for all to see – the steady escalation of tit-for-tat, in which each new majority weakens the guardrails of the Senate and excludes input from the other party, furthering resentment and anger amongst this body and our constituents at home. 
 
Democrats’ increased use of requiring cloture for judicial nominees under President George W. Bush led to similar tactics by Republicans under President Barack Obama. 
 
The 2013 decision by Senate Democrats to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for most judicial and presidential nominations led directly to a response in 2017 by Senate Republicans, who eliminated the threshold for Supreme Court nominees.
 
These short-sighted actions by both parties have led to our current American Judiciary and Supreme Court, which, as I stand here today, is considering questions regarding fundamental rights Americans have enjoyed for decades. 
  
Eliminating the 60-vote threshold – on a party line with the thinnest of possible majorities – to pass these bills that I support will not guarantee that we prevent demagogues from winning office. 
 
Indeed, some who undermine the principles of democracy have already been elected. 
 
Rather, eliminating the 60-vote threshold will simply guarantee that we lose a critical tool that we need to safeguard our democracy from threats in the years to come.
 
It is clear that the two parties’ strategies are not working – not for either side, and especially not for the country.
 
You know, it’s comfortable for members of each party, particularly those who’ve spent their careers are spent in party politics, to think their respective party alone can move the country forward. 
 
Party control becomes a goal in and of itself – instead of prioritizing a healthy, appropriate balance in which Americans’ diverse views and shared values are represented.
 
But when one party needs only negotiate within itself, policy will inextricably be pushed from the middle toward the extremes. 
 
I understand there are some on both sides of the aisle who prefer that outcome, but I do not. I know that Arizonans do not either. 
 
Our country’s first president, George Washington – a leader whose wisdom I borrowed at the conclusion of the 2020 impeachment trial – he warned against political factions more than 200 years ago, saying that extreme partisanship could lead to the “ruins of public liberty.” 
 
“I was no party man myself,” Washington wrote, “and the first wish of my heart was, if parties did exist, to reconcile them.”
 
Today, we serve in an equally divided Senate. And today marks the longest time in history that the Senate has been equally divided. 
 
The House of Representatives is nearly equally divided as well. 
 
Our mandate? It seems evident to me – work together and get stuff done for America. 
 
The past years have shown: when a party in control pushes party-line changes exceeding their electoral mandate, the bitterness within our politics is exacerbated, tensions are raised within the country, and traditionally non-partisan issues are transformed into partisan wedges. 
 
We must address the disease itself – the disease of division – to protect our democracy. 
 
It cannot be achieved by one party alone. It cannot be achieved solely by the federal government.
 
The response requires something greater – and yes, more difficult – than what the Senate is discussing today. 
 
We need robust, sustained strategies that put aside party labels and focus on our democracy – because these challenges are bigger than party affiliation. 
 
We must commit to a long-term approach as serious as the problems we seek to solve – one that prioritizes listening and understanding. One that embraces making progress on shared priorities, and finding common ground on issues where we hold differing and diverse views.
 
This work requires all Americans everywhere. Efforts to fix these problems on a bare-majority party line will only succeed in exacerbating the root-causes that gave way to these state laws in the first place, extending our descent into a more fragmented America.
 
This work is our shared responsibility as Americans.
 
I share the disappointment of many that we have not found more support on the other side of the aisle for legislative responses to state-level voting restrictions.
 
I wish that were not the case – just as I wish there had been a more serious effort on the part of Democratic Party leaders to sit down with the other party and genuinely discuss how to re-forge common ground on these issues.
 
My Republican colleagues have a duty to meet their shared responsibility to protect access to voting and the integrity of our electoral process.
 
We need a sustained, robust effort to defend American democracy – an effort on the part of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and all Americans in communities across this country.
 
So we ask: what must we do to protect our democracy? 
 
We should invest heavily in recruiting and supporting state and local candidates for office – in both parties – who represent the values enshrined in our Constitution.
 
We should ensure we have a Judiciary that is less lopsided in its political leanings, and that we can all depend on to uphold the Constitution.
 
We must confront and combat the rise of rampant disinformation and ensure that all Americans have the tools to see fact from fiction. This will be particularly difficult work, since some in power have used disinformation to manipulate our differences and pull Americans apart, pressuring us to see our fellow Americans as enemies
 
The dangers facing our democracy took years to metastasize. 
 
And they will take years of sustained, focused effort to effectively reverse.
 
There are steps that we can take today to fix our politics and better set the stage for repairing our democracy.
 
Many of you know I began my career as a social worker.
 
And in our social work training, our first necessary skill is the ability to listen to others – listening not to argue or rebut, but listening to understand.
 
I ran for the United States Senate rejecting partisanship, willing to work with anyone to help Arizonans build better and more secure lives. 
 
And throughout my time serving Arizona, I have listened – to Arizonans expressing diverse views on inflation, economic competitiveness, climate and social priorities, and the role of the federal government itself. 
 
I find myself grateful time and time again to learn from Arizonans who share the same core values, but differ in position on issues and policies. Their similarities and their differences are surely representative of the complexity of Americans nationwide. 
 
So I find this question answers itself: 
 
Can two Americans of sharp intellect and good faith reach different conclusions to the same question? 
 
Yes. Yes, of course they can. 
 
It is easy for elected officials to give speeches about what they believe. It is harder to listen and acknowledge that there are a whole lot of Americans with different ideas about what is important in our country and how to solve those problems.
 
And yet, it is important to recognize that disagreements are okay. They are normal – and honest disagreements matched with a willingness to listen and learn can help us forge sturdy and enduring solutions. 
 
Congress was designed to bring together Americans of diverse views, representing different interests and – as a collective – to find compromise and common ground to serve our country as a whole. 
 
We face serious challenges, and meeting them must start with a willingness to be honest, to listen to one another, to lower the political temperature, and to seek lasting solutions. 
 
Some have given up on the goal of easing our divisions and uniting Americans. I have not.
 
I’ve worked hard to demonstrate in my public service the value of working with unlikely allies to get results – helping others see our common humanity and finding our common ground. 
 
And I remain stubbornly optimistic, because this is America. We have overcome every challenge we’ve ever faced.
 
I am committed to doing my part to avoid toxic political rhetoric, to build bridges, to forge common ground, and to achieve lasting results for Arizona and this country.
 
But we are in desperate need of more. More people who are willing to listen, to seek understanding, to stitch together the fabric of our country that has been ripping ‘round the edges. More people who are willing to put down the sticks sharpened for battle and instead pick up their neighbors to learn why they are angry or upset or left behind. 
 
So I call on each of us as Americans – let us be those people.
 
We are but one country. We have but one democracy. We can only survive, we can only keep her if we do so together.
 
Thank you."

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-kelly-applaud-25-million-arizona-highway-repairs,"The Department of Transportation announced emergency funding for Arizona highways damaged by recent natural disastersWASHINGTON – Arizona Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly applauded the U.S. Department of Transportation’s decision to award $25 million to Arizona highway repairs following recent natural disasters.
 
“Following recent extreme weather, today’s funding will provide needed repairs to Arizona roads and highways, creating jobs, strengthening economic opportunities, and helping connect Arizonans to services they rely on,” said Sinema.
 
“This funding will help repair roads damaged by floods and wildfires across Arizona,” said Kelly. “Not only is this a safety issue, it’s an economic one. By funding roads in need of renovations, we can ensure our transportation system is up to the task of supporting communities and businesses.”
 
The Department of Transportation announced $9 million for repairs following the City of Phoenix 7th street Bridge Fire, $4.3 million for repairs following monsoon storms and flooding in August 2021, $5.6 million for highway repairs caused by the Mescal and Telegraph fires in 2021, $1.3 million for repairs from storms and flooding in 2021, $1.7 million for repairs caused by Hurricane Rosa in 2018, $2.3 million in repairs caused by Tropical Storm Lorena in 2019, and $1.3 million for repairs from the Frye Fire in 2017.

https://www.sinema.senate.gov/695-million-investment-coming-arizona-airports-bipartisan-infrastructure-law,"Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law led by Sinema and shaped by Kelly provides resources for critical repairs and upgrades to America’s airportsWASHINGTON - $69.5 million will be invested in Arizona airports from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law led by Senator Kyrsten Sinema and shaped by Senator Mark Kelly.
 
“Arizona’s airports serve as economic engines for our state. Our bipartisan infrastructure law directly invests in our airports, boosting tourism, creating jobs, and expanding economic opportunities for Arizonans,” said Sinema, Chair of the Senate Aviation Safety, Operations, and Innovation Subcommittee.
 
“Our airports are vital economic drivers for our state. Today’s funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped negotiate will support necessary upgrades and modernization projects at our airports that will fuel job growth, boost tourism, and help our economy grow,” said Senator Kelly.
 
Sinema led bipartisan Senate negotiations with Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio that included Senator Kelly and senators from both parties. As Chair of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, Sinema ensured that the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law includes significant resources for major upgrades to every airport in the state, and airports across the country. This historic investment will create jobs, improve passenger safety, boost tourism, and ensure Arizona continues to lead the aviation industry.
 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law invests $15 billion in priority projects at every airport in the United States. Of this funding, Arizona airports are expected to receive a total of at least $360 million over the next five years. Such upgrades would include: runways and taxiways, safety upgrades, terminal development projects, noise mitigation, and multimodal transportation. This funding program provides flexibility for airports to address their specific needs, and is formula-driven, so the funds will go directly to the airports.  The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law also provides $5 billion in competitive grants for terminal development and other landside projects. These resources ensure terminal projects at all types of airports, including small hub airports, nonhub, and nonprimary airports will receive funding -- guaranteeing that communities of all sizes benefit. Additionally, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs law invests an another $5 billion in grants for strengthening Air Traffic Control towers and infrastructure -- much of which is decades-old and requires upgrades to house new equipment to better keep American travelers safe.
 
The bipartisan infrastructure law was supported by groups including The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, The National Association of Manufacturers, The AFL-CIO, The National Retail Federation, The Bipartisan Policy Center, North America’s Building Trades Unions, the Outdoor Industry Association, The American Hotel and Lodging Association, The National Education Association, as well as hundreds of mayors across all 50 states."

Agreement paves way for the strongest investment in America’s critical infrastructure in a century without raising taxesWASHINGTON – Arizona’s senior U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema spoke tonight on the Senate floor introducing formal legislative text of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—historic legislation resulting from negotiations that she co-led with Republican Senator Rob Portman (Ohio) that invests in America’s critical infrastructure without raising taxes.Below is Sinema’s speech as delivered.Thank you, Mr. President. It’s my honor and privilege this evening to join with the fellow nine senators at the G 10 who’ve been working together for months now, along with an additional 12 colleagues who together, the 22 of us Senators have worked long and hard with each other and with the White House to introduce this evening the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.We know that this has been a long and sometimes difficult process. But we are proud this evening to announce this legislation. And we look forward very much to working with our colleagues in a collaborative and open way over the coming days to work through this historic investment in infrastructure in our country and to come to agreement in the United States Senate to move forward with this historic piece of legislation. 
Now, I know many of my colleagues will talk about some of the virtues of the legislation and the great things that will do for the states that we all are proud to represent, the states that all of us senators represent across this country. But what I’d like to direct my brief remarks to this evening, Mr. President, are not the details of this legislative text, though, they are significant and I think they’re very meaningful and will have an impact on the daily lives of Americans. What I’d like to speak about is the very process. I know it has been difficult and I know that it’s been hard, and what I am proud to say is that this is what our forefathers intended when they created a system of government that required Republicans and Democrats to come together in a coequal branch of government and work with each other and with the administration to find legislation and solutions that meet the needs of our country’s individuals and families, companies, communities. It is difficult, it is time consuming, and it is exactly what our country insists and demands of us every single day to take the time to work with each other, to find common ground, to compromise and to be willing to work with each other, to give a little, to get a little, in order to achieve what’s right and what’s best for the American people. I think that the process we’re embarking on this evening, as we soon will join together with our colleagues of both political parties representing every state across the country is an important one. And it sends a message to the individuals across this country and indeed to individuals across this world that the United States government can work.It is difficult, it is time consuming, it can be hard. But this very process of finding bipartisan compromise and working together to overcome obstacles, to achieve the objectives that the American people are depending upon us to do is the very heart and the very core of why each of us serve in this government. And I, for one, in addition to being tired, I for one am incredibly proud of this process. It is why I ran for office, and I believe it is why we’ve all run for office, to work together, to overcome differences, to find solutions, and to make a difference in the lives of the American people, as we will see in the coming days, as we hear from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle offering amendments and adjustments to this legislation and ultimately, I believe, passing this legislation out of the Senate. Strong bipartisan record, we will continue to once again demonstrate to our country and to the world that we can indeed do our jobs, that we can legislate, that we can work together, and then we can put aside our own political differences for the greater good of our country. Thank you, Mr. President."

“Expanding self-management training empowers Arizona Medicare recipients who have diabetes to manage the condition through certified health experts in order to live healthier lives,” said Sinema.
 
The Diabetes Self-Management Training Act helps Arizonans with diabetes learn from certified diabetes educators about how to manage their diabetes, prevent complications, and hospitalizations. The bipartisan legislation expands the diabetes self-management training benefit for Medicare beneficiaries by removing the one-year limit on coverage, so the beneficiary could roll over their unused training hours to future years if unused at the end of the first year, and testing out virtual trainings to reach more beneficiaries.
 
Diabetes self-management training is conducted by certified diabetes educators who teach Medicare patients on how to manage their diabetes. Patients who go through diabetes self-management training see improved care, lower health care costs, and a lower mortality rate. Medicare currently covers 10 hours of diabetes self-management care for patients with diabetes within a year of their diagnosis, if they are referred by their primary health care provider.
 
Approximately 600,000 Arizona adults have been diagnosed with diabetes. Before the coronavirus pandemic, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in Arizona.

The Ensuring Survivor Benefits During COVID Act—bipartisan legislation Sinema and Republican Senator Thom Tillis (N.C.) introduced—ensures family members of veterans who passed away due to COVID-19 receive the survivor benefits they’ve earned. The Sinema-backed Veterans’ Disability Compensation COLA Act increases the VA disability compensation rates.
 
“Arizona veterans and their families make incredible sacrifices to keep our country, state, and communities safe. These two bipartisan bills ensure Arizona veterans and their families receive the care, benefits, and resources they’ve earned,” said Sinema, a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.
 
Sinema’s bipartisan Ensuring Survivor Benefits During COVID Act was inspired by stories she heard during her regular calls with Arizona veteran serving organizations to discuss coronavirus relief efforts. Currently, veterans who pass away from coronavirus may have their cause of death identified as “COVID-19” without accounting for service related disabilities that further complicate their coronavirus diagnosis. Sinema’s bill ensures those disabilities are taken into account so family members have access to benefits they’ve earned.
 
The Sinema-backed Veterans’ Disability Compensation COLA Act—bipartisan legislation increases the rates of VA disability compensation, dependency compensation for surviving children and spouses, and the clothing allowance for veterans based on rising costs of living. This cost-of-living adjustment is equal to the amount of the adjustment given to Social Security recipients.
 
In May, along with Sinema’s Ensuring Survivor Benefits During COVID Act and the Veterans’ Disability Compensation COLA Act, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee also passed the Sinema-backed Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act, which helps veterans’ families access educational benefits."

With President Biden’s support, sweeping proposal now moves to U.S. House for consideration.WASHINGTON – In a broad show of support from both parties, the U.S. Senate voted 69-30 to approve the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—sweeping legislation led by Senator Kyrsten Sinema to make historic investments in repairing and upgrading America’s critical infrastructure. Arizona’s roads, bridges, broadband networks, water systems, transit, power grids, airports, and other infrastructure would see significant upgrades and expansions through the bipartisan proposal—which is supported by President Biden, and now moves to the U.S. House of Representatives for consideration.
 
Sinema partnered with Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio to co-lead Senate negotiations with eight other Senators—four from each party—and the White House to craft the legislation. The bill, which does not raise taxes on everyday Americans, was debated on the Senate floor this past week with more than 20 amendments from both parties considered, and several adopted.
 
“From better roads and more reliable power grids, to faster internet in more corners of our state, to safer airports and cleaner water – everyday families in Arizona and across the country will see big benefits from our bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Remarks as prepared for delivery:
 
Mr. President:
 
I rise today as we approach a final Senate vote on historic legislation to invest in America’s critical infrastructure -- a bipartisan proposal that will make America stronger and safer, create good-paying jobs, and expand economic opportunities across the country.
 
After months of negotiations, the Senate has now debated our bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for nearly two weeks in an open legislative process.
 
We have considered more than 20 amendments from both sides of the aisle, and voted to adopt many of those amendments.
 
In the coming hours, the Senate will have the opportunity to approve legislation that meets the needs of everyday families, employers, and communities.
 
For decades, American infrastructure has been crumbling. For decades, American families have asked Congress for infrastructure investment. And for decades, progress was blocked by partisan disagreements.
 
Now, as the Senate prepares for a final vote, what will this historic legislation actually mean for the people we serve?
 
Our bill will mean better roads by investing a historic 110 billion dollars to repair and upgrade our roadways, bridges, and other major transportation projects.
 
It will mean faster internet for more people in more places by investing 65 billion dollars to deploy high-speed broadband and help families afford internet service.
 
It will mean cleaner, more reliable water sources by making the strongest investment in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in U.S. history -- including water storage and recycling and drought contingency plans throughout Western states like Arizona.
It will mean fewer power outages and stronger, more reliable electricity grids by investing 65 billion dollars in power infrastructure.
 
It will mean better protections against wildfires by investing in fire suppression and recovery, and the removal of hazardous fuels.
 
It will mean stronger water and sanitation systems, and better broadband access, in Tribal communities -- as well as full funding for all currently-authorized Indian Water Settlements. In Arizona, that includes: 
Our legislation will mean safer, more convenient airports by investing 25 billion dollars to repair and upgrade terminals, runways, taxiways, and air traffic control towers.
 
It will mean the strongest investment ever in American public transit by expanding transit networks, improving accessibility, and funding the nation’s transit repair backlog of thousands of buses, rail cars, stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems.
And it will mean the largest investment in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in U.S. history, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses, boosting critical materials supply chains, and building out a national network of electric vehicle charging stations.
 
And we achieve all of these goals without raising taxes on everyday Americans.
 
Strong, reliable infrastructure represents more than pipes and pavement.
 
It represents the opportunities for Americans to visit loved ones, new businesses to open and compete globally, veterans to access tele-medicine, and children to learn in safe and effective ways.
 
That is why our legislation has earned the support of such a wide cross-section of Americans. 
 
From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to the AFL-CIO -- from agricultural producers to clean energy leaders -- from health care providers to transit advocates to local mayors -- the list of experts and organizations that have endorsed our Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is long enough to take an entire speech just to list them all. Don’t worry, I won’t.
 
Rarely does federal legislation so directly address issues that matter to all our constituents -- and rarer, still, does such historic legislation earn broad support in both parties.
 
How many times have we heard in recent months that bipartisanship isn’t possible anymore?
 
We have been asked to accept a new standard by which important policy can only come together on a party line.
 
While Americans are more united than our politics would have you believe, we certainly face divisions.
 
Unfortunately it is now commonplace -- and by some, it is even expected -- for elected leaders to feed those divisions on a daily basis, with extreme and hyperbolic rhetoric, all-or-nothing policy demands, and toxic partisan attacks.
 
In Washington, palace-intrigue and insider-drama often steal the spotlight from important policy issues.
 
I promised Arizonans something different.
 
I chose, instead, to follow the example of Senator John McCain -- who, as the Arizona Republic recently recalled, “refused to demonize the opposition party and worked to reach bipartisan agreements that tried to bring the country together.”
 
This infrastructure effort is a perfect example of how I work to deliver results for Arizona.
 
It’s the easiest thing in the world for politicians to stay in their partisan corners -- to line up on their respective sides of every partisan battle and declare that bipartisanship is dead.
 
What’s harder is getting out of our comfort zones and forming coalitions with unlikely allies that can achieve lasting results.
 
Lasting results -- rather than temporary victories, destined to be reversed, undermining the certainty that Americans depend on.
 
Ask just about any constituent in any of our states about our country’s political divisions, and you will hear a desire from America’s citizens for all of us to find ways to bridge our differences and work together to address the issues that actually matter to their daily lives.
 
Our bipartisan Senate group that negotiated this historic legislation -- and those we’ve partnered with to strengthen the bill throughout this process -- provide an example of how to achieve that goal.
 
In a demonstration of how the Senate was designed to work, the Senators in our group effectively represented the needs of the regions we represent -- Senator Cassidy in the deep south and gulf coast, Senator Warner in the mid-Atlantic, Senator Manchin in Appalachia, and Senators Romney and Tester in the West.
 
And with Senator Portman representing the Midwest, the Northeast and Alaska -- each with unique infrastructure needs -- were ably represented by Senators Shaheen, Collins, and Murkowski.
 
In what should not be a surprise to anyone, those women in our bipartisan group brought a no-drama work ethic, policy expertise, and knowledge of our regions’ priorities that earned my designation of them as the “Wonder Women.”
 
I sincerely thank my partner in co-leading this effort, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio -- whose knowledge on issues ranging from permitting requirements to the federal budget is matched only by his steadfast commitment to delivering on this priority for our country.
 
I am just not sure how we, or our teams, will manage daily schedules without the endless meetings, calls, and Zooms, negotiating the nuances of funding formulas and CBO scores. Just kidding, we will manage.
 
Our bipartisan group eventually grew to include more than 20 Senators, including my fellow Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.
 
And a significant portion of our legislation is made up of the surface transportation reauthorization, which was painstakingly assembled in serious, bipartisan committee negotiations led by Senators Carper, Capito, Cantwell, Wicker, Brown, Toomey, and many others.
 
Our proposal is a historic deal for communities across the country because of their hard work and expertise.
 
We have worked closely with U.S. House leaders in the Problem Solvers Caucus, whose support will be crucial as our legislation moves to the House.
 
Through every step in these negotiations, President Biden and his team -- as well as Majority Leader Schumer -- stood firmly behind us, helping navigate difficult challenges. I’m honored that we have earned Republican Leader McConnell’s support, as well.
 
I would like to especially thank my legislative director Michael Brownlie for his hard work, and my entire policy team, who worked tirelessly over countless hours -- along with other Senate staff and President Biden's team at the White House -- to help turn our negotiated framework into legislation.
 
This is what it looks like when elected leaders set aside differences, shut out the noise and distractions, and focus on forging common ground around our shared values.
 
This is what it looks like for elected leaders to ignore extreme rhetoric and cheap political attacks, and put energy instead into delivering lasting results that matter to everyday Americans.
 
This is what it looks like for elected leaders to take a step toward healing our country’s divisions, rather than feeding those divisions.
 
With those shared values in mind, I urge my colleagues in both parties to support the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and help show the world that our democracy still works, and that we still lead the world in innovation and competitiveness, and that Americans can be confident that our government is working for all of us, and worthy of all of us.
 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Inter Tribal Association of Arizona (Vice Chairman Shan Lewis, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe, President of the Inter Tribal Association)
“The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act led by Senator Sinema will make historic and long overdue investments in Tribal communities. These investments will be in support of Tribal roads, clean water, broadband, security, and will help expand jobs and business opportunities on Tribal lands. We support Senator Sinema’s leadership on this effort and urge swift passage of this historic bill into law.”
 
Arizona Chamber of Commerce
“After months of negotiations between both parties, the Senate’s passage of this legislation marks a critical first step in improving the infrastructure of Arizona and the United States. Arizona’s job creators applaud Sen. Sinema for her commitment to bipartisan cooperation that has resulted in a bill that will make major advancements in the state’s ability to connect its rural communities to high-speed internet, to facilitate cross-border trade through its international ports of entry, to better manage our precious water resources, and much more. We encourage the House to take up this bill as soon as possible so that it can be signed into law.”
 
Greater Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce (Julie Pastrick, President/CEO)
“With Senator Sinema fighting in Washington for rural Arizona, rural Arizonans keep winning. Her leadership on the bi-partisan infrastructure bill provides much needed results for northern Arizona including important airport improvements, and much needed broadband access and expansion. Senator Sinema is helping narrow the digital divide for rural Arizonans, and our business communities will be better off for the work.”
 
Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego
“The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an exciting step forward towards re-emerging from the pandemic. It will accelerate completion of critical transportation projects, as well as many important infrastructure priorities. These projects will allow us to create more high-paying jobs and connect every resident to economic opportunities across our city. Phoenix applauds Senator Sinema and congress’ work to shape and pass this important legislation.”
 
Globe Mayor Al Gameros
“Senator Sinema not only knows the pulse of Arizona, but of America. The Bi-partisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 is comprehensive and meaningful legislation that will positively affect every aspect of our citizen’s lives. In particular, I am thrilled to see that Senator Sinema was able to include an additional $200 million for the Forest Service’s Burned Area Recovery (BEAR) program to assist with post-fire recovery including erosion control projects like those needed near Globe, Arizona, following this year’s Telegraph Fire. Senator Sinema continues to deliver for Globe and Arizona and we are proud of her hard work to make this legislation a reality.”
 
Pinnacle West/APS (Jeff Guldner, APS Chairman/CEO)
“We applaud Senator Sinema’s efforts on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Arizonans will benefit from infrastructure investments including energy grid enhancements, new carbon-free technologies, electric school buses, vehicle charging stations and rural broadband; all of which support our state’s clean energy future and APS’s path to serving customers reliably and affordably with 100-percent carbon-free energy.""
 
Arizona Lodging and Tourism Association (Kim Sabow, President/CEO)
“Arizona's tourism industry is the cornerstone of our economy, welcoming 46.8 million overnight visitors in 2019 who spent $26.5 billion in the Grand Canyon State. The COVID-19 pandemic brought the industry to a halt, impacting countless businesses and employees. As we continue to navigate the pandemic, it is vital that federal leaders make strategic investments that will allow the industry to recover and thrive. The bipartisan infrastructure package will provide much needed resources to Arizona's airports, highways, and other modes of transportation to make travel more efficient. We thank Senator Sinema for her steadfast leadership on this historic package and urge swift approval in the U.S. House of Representatives.”
 
Greater Phoenix Economic Council (Chris Camacho, President/CEO)
“Sen. Sinema’s efforts to pass critical bipartisan legislation that advances Arizona’s current and future infrastructure is vital to meet the ongoing demands of our state.
