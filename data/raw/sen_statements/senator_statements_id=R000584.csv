https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-crapo-capito-introduce-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo (both R-Idaho) joined Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and 40 of their Republican colleagues to introduce the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act,  comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform legislation.“The Biden administration has made it nearly impossible to advance critical energy, infrastructure, and natural resource projects, and Idahoans are paying for it each time they fill up at the pump or visit the grocery store,” said Risch. “Comprehensive permitting reform will secure our domestic energy supply, ease the blow to Idahoans’ bank accounts, and bring us one step closer to fixing the supply chains this administration has so badly broken.”“It’s past time to cut the onerous red tape delaying key energy and infrastructure projects across the country,” Crapo said.  “The START Act takes a page from Idaho’s playbook, eliminating unnecessary burdens to provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and codify regulatory reforms.”“Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” Capito said. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish line.”A full list of cosponsors can be found here.Full text of the legislation can be found here.A section-by-section summary can be found here.BACKGROUND:Since his first day in office, President Biden has limited and canceled critical energy and natural resources projects, such as shutting down construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and walking back modernizations to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process.Democrats passed legislation that will raise taxes and spend hundreds of billions of dollars in exchange for a promise of permitting reform, but they have yet to release text to the public. Meanwhile, Republicans have offered solutions to improve energy, infrastructure and supply chains immediately.  Senators Risch and Crapo supported an amendment filed by Senator Capito during debate of the reconciliation bill that would have reformed burdensome regulations currently delaying key energy and infrastructure projects across the country. The amendment failed by a vote of 49-50, with all 50 Senate Democrats voting against it. Senators Risch and Crapo have also joined legislation to reject the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule, continue the Keystone XL Pipeline, and actively manage Idaho’s forests.Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-crapo-capito-introduce-comprehensive-regulatory-and-permitting-reform-legislation"
https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-rubio-introduce-legislation-to-make-federal-grant-process-easier-for-small-local-governments,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) joined Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to introduce the Simplifying Grants Act to make it easier for local governments, with less than 50,000 people, to apply for, receive, and manage grants. Small local governments often face difficulties when applying for, and managing, federal grants in comparison to larger ones.The Simplifying Grants Act would require that agencies simplify the often complex, time consuming, and expensive grant process for all current and future federal grant opportunities. This would benefit 37 out of Idaho’s 44 counties (84%) and 2,147 out of the country’s 3,143 counties (68%) as well as thousands of other cities, towns, and other governmental entities.“While larger communities can navigate a complex federal grants process, Idaho’s small, rural communities are often overlooked and left behind. It is only fair that taxpayer dollars reach even the smallest corners of our state,” said Risch. “Simplifying grants for our local governments will level the playing field and ensure that federal taxpayer dollars come back to their own communities.”“Local governments use federal dollars to invest in infrastructure, public safety, law enforcement, and our children’s education, among other important priorities. Regretfully, our current grant process leaves small local governments and their residents behind,” said Rubio. “This bill would provide a simplified process so small local governments are able to apply for and receive the funds they need.”Additional cosponsors of the bill include Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Cornyn (R-Texas), and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.).# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-rubio-introduce-legislation-to-make-federal-grant-process-easier-for-small-local-governments"
https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-tillis-colleagues-demand-answers-on-proposed-sanctuary-policies-to-release-criminal-illegal-immigrants,"WASHINGTON – Last week, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and 10 Senate colleagues sent a letter to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Ronald Davis demanding answers after reports that the USMS is considering a new policy to permit the release of dangerous, criminal aliens before U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is able to apprehend these illegal immigrants.“We are deeply concerned to learn that USMS is even considering adopting a policy where it fails to cooperate with a fellow federal law enforcement entity,”  the senators wrote. “The partnership between USMS and ICE is critical to ensure that dangerous, criminal aliens are detained and deported. Preventing USMS from communicating with ICE would be a dereliction of federal immigration enforcement, and we strongly discourage you from proceeding with this proposed policy.”Additional signers of the letter include Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).The senators continued, “The Biden Administration’s failed immigration policies continue to fuel a crisis on our southern border. Since President Biden took office, CBP has had 3 million encounters with illegal immigrants at our southern border. Further, there continues to be a growing number of ‘gotaways’ entering the country due to the chaos at the border. Recent reports indicate over 500,000 illegal immigrants evaded capture so far in fiscal year 2022 (FY22). These potentially dangerous, criminal aliens pose a significant risk to public safety, especially in states and communities that have adopted sanctuary policies.” The senators concluded, “Even Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has spoken out against dangerous sanctuary city policies. Speaking before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledged that some cities are releasing illegal immigrants, ‘even if those individuals pose a public safety threat,’ and that, ‘the public’s safety, the public’s well-being . . . is I think at issue.’ In light of this public safety risk, Secretary Mayorkas indicated he would be going to municipal leaders and ‘asking you to reconsider your position of non-cooperation . . .”Read the full letter here.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/risch-tillis-colleagues-demand-answers-on-proposed-sanctuary-policies-to-release-criminal-illegal-immigrants"
https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/opinion,"More than three million people have been caught trying to illegally cross the southern border since President Biden took office.Taken together, the number would beat out Chicago for the third largest city in America. That would fill Boise State’s Albertsons Stadium 82 times. It exceeds the entire population of Idaho by more than one million people.Incredibly, that three million number doesn’t even account for the more than half a million “gotaways” we know have disappeared into the U.S. since last October.We are in a crisis, and this crisis did not happen by accident. We got here through a combination of bad decisions, bad policies, and rhetoric that allowed the southern border to devolve into a catch-all for human trafficking, criminal violence, and deadly drugs.That is why as the lead Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, I released a report on the Biden administration’s failed policies which are spurring this crisis and outlined the steps needed to get us out of it. Then, I introduced the Solving the Border Crisis Act to implement commonsense solutions to secure the border and stop this disaster from getting any worse.President Biden’s failed border policies have led criminal cartels to inhumane lengths, like packing vulnerable migrants into trucks and leaving them to die before reaching their intended destination. Crime syndicates are making huge profits, charging migrants upwards of $20,000 to be smuggled into the U.S. Meanwhile, record numbers of children are being exploited by cartel members who systematically force them to cross the border with adult strangers in an attempt to secure lax family unit treatment under Biden administration rules.Over 16,000 criminals have been arrested at the border since the start of last year on charges ranging from sex crimes to homicide. Felons benefit from the “catch and release” loophole that perversely guarantees their release into the interior of our country if they are not accepted for deportation by another country within six months. This is a problem Senator Mike Crapo and I take seriously, and in June we cosponsored legislation to close that loophole.These criminals are accelerating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States. We see this in Idaho every day. Recently, Idaho news outlets ran a story how the DEA had seized one million fentanyl pills in a single drug bust. If not for this monumental bust, some portion of these counterfeit pills would be in Idaho today. Here at home, fentanyl seizures have increased nearly 500 percent, and Idaho State Police Captain John Kempf has sounded the alarm that fentanyl is showing up in Idaho high schools and killing kids as young as 15 years old.Until the border is secure, fentanyl will continue to infiltrate our communities with ease and kill Idahoans of all ages and walks of life.We do not have to remain in this crisis. My bill, the Solving the Border Crisis Act, can end this border crisis by reinstating the effective immigration policies that President Biden ended on his first day in office including the extension of Title 42, immediately resuming construction of the border wall, and making the “Remain in Mexico” program permanent. I cannot stress enough the importance of implementing these solutions immediately to protect our children, our neighbors, our sovereignty, and our national security.We have the tools to equip our southern border with the proper resources and infrastructure to combat this unconscionable surge. It’s just a matter of enforcing the rule of law and an Administration that can get its act together.Word Count: 588Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/opinion"

Additional signers of the letters include Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Representatives Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), and Cliff Bentz (R-Ore.). “[W]e were appalled by the lack of transparency and obvious political intervention in processes regarding the recent release of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) draft ‘report’ relating to the Columbia River Basin. Even more alarming, we have received further indication of political maneuvering by this administration to prevent information on the costs of replacing the power generated by the Lower Snake River dams on the Federal Columbia River Power System from being made public prior to the release of the previously mentioned NOAA draft ‘report,’” the lawmakers wrote.  “The recent actions by this administration have sown complete distrust in this administration’s ability to lead with facts, science, and transparency regarding the Columbia River System,” the lawmakers continued. “These actions will undoubtedly have long-term and damaging effects on this administration’s ability to bring diverse stakeholders together to chart a path forward on species recovery and preservation of the vital benefits of the Columbia River System.”Click here to read the letter to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm.Click here to read the letter to NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad.Click here to read the letter to CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory.Click here to read the letter to BPA Administrator John Hairston.Background: The four hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River provide multiple benefits to Idaho and the region, including flood risk management, economic stimulus, crop irrigation, and clean hydropower.Following four years of  comprehensive scientific study of the Columbia River System Operations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation and Bonneville Power Administration released a  record of decision in September 2020 affirming the four dams’ critical importance to the region.In March, Risch and Rodgers also led PNW lawmakers in demanding answers from ten federal agencies involved in the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)’s exploration of plans to breach the Lower Snake River dams.

This bill will secure the southern border by resuming construction of the border wall, strengthening management and enforcement capacities, and upholding the rule of law.“The Biden administration’s dismantling of the effective immigration system it inherited has created a full-blown disaster at the southern border. The past few months of illegal migrant encounters have broken every record in the book, and there is no end in sight unless we secure our border with strong immigration policies,” said Risch. “Using several of the findings of my recent migration report, I’m proud to introduce the Solving the Border Crisis Act to prevent this national security and public health disaster from getting any worse.”“The skyrocketing amounts of fentanyl and unlawful migrants coming over our border must stop. The irresponsible and dangerous border policies of this administration are allowing Mexican transnational criminal organizations to traffic record numbers of unlawful migrants and deadly, illicit narcotics into communities in Ohio and throughout the country,"" said Portman. ""That’s why I’m proud to introduce this bill to implement the recommendations from our recent border report to end the catastrophe at our border to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.""The Solving the Border Crisis Act will:Text of the bill can be found here.A one pager on the bill can be found here.Background: Under the Biden administration, illegal immigration has reached some of the highest levels ever recorded.

It also published a study commissioned by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) laying out scenarios to replace power generated by the dams.In response, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) issued the following statement:“In a time of record inflation and soaring energy prices, the Biden administration is endorsing a plan to rip out the Northwest’s clean energy assets while in the same breath asserting climate change is the largest existential threat. Even a study they commissioned acknowledged that energy replacement alone could cost over $75 billion, and unlike the comprehensive and public Columbia River System Operation review, this limited analysis was done in secret and without process,” said Risch. “Only Congress – not the President – has the authority to remove these dams. Now more than ever, I remain adamantly opposed to breaching the dams on the Lower Snake River.”Background: The four hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River provide multiple benefits to Idaho and the region, including flood risk management, economic stimulus, crop irrigation, and clean hydropower.Following four years of  comprehensive scientific study of the Columbia River System Operations, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation and Bonneville Power Administration released a  record of decision in September 2020 affirming the four dams’ critical importance to the region.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/risch-on-white-house-dam-breaching-reports"

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/senate-republicans-report-condemns-biden-s-border-crisis,"By Simon Hankinson - June 24, 2022Consumers of the mainstream media might think that all news stopped on Jan. 6, 2021, but readers of The Daily Signal know that illegal crossings at the U.S. border are at “astronomical and record-breaking levels,” as a just issued report from the Republican minority on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee puts it.The 47-page report, “Biden’s Border Crisis: Examining Policies That Encourage Illegal Migration,” describes the ongoing disgrace on our southern border and the utter failure of the Obama and Biden administrations to address it, concluding with some recommendations for immediate action to secure our country from uncontrolled illegal immigration.First, the numbers: The report says that 234,088 foreigners were encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border attempting to illegally enter the country in April. That’s the highest-ever monthly total.That staggering record was already broken, even as the report was being written. In May, “there were 239,416 encounters along the southwest land border,” according to government figures.That doesn’t count the unknown (and unknowable) number that evaded detection entirely. One estimate puts that number—the “got-aways”—at about a third (32%) of those caught, which would mean more than 600,000 last year.According to the report, most illegal crossers still come from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), but the number from elsewhere increased nearly nine times between President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January 2021 and March of this year to more than 88,000.It seems not just Ecuadorians, Haitians, and Cubans, but also Cameroonians, Bangladeshis, and Chinese have received the message from the Biden administration that the border is wide open to illegal crossing without credible repercussions.As 2022 rolls on, we are well on target to exceed the 1.7 million illegal immigrants apprehended on the southern border in 2021, which was itself an unprecedented number.As the report makes clear, this crisis has been brewing for decades. The “push factors” in Latin America (not to mention much of Africa and Asia) get worse: feckless governments, corruption, poverty, and economies hampered by socialism or incompetence, or incapable of harnessing the labor of their burgeoning populations.Transnational criminal organizations such as the Tijuana cartel and gangs such as MS-13 have established themselves as essential brokers on the route into the U.S. and are making billions.The report says that “55% of those traveling illegally [use] a smuggler” at rates up to $10,000 a head. Illegal crossers from the Northern Triangle alone paid out an estimated $1.7 billion in 2021 to get through Mexico into the U.S.Meanwhile, what has the U.S. done about it?To summarize the report’s conclusion, we have spent billions of dollars in foreign assistance in failed efforts to tackle the “root causes” of immigration. No doubt some of it reached the target countries, but much will have gone in administration and overhead fees to the “Beltway bandits” run by nongovernmental organizations with government connections.The Obama administration’s Strategy for Engagement in Central America was built on the fantasy that any amount of U.S. money (in that case, $3.6 billion) could fix what ails the countries to our south.The idea that we can spend enough on noble but vague goals such as security cooperation, promoting economic prosperity, encouraging good government, and fighting corruption in El Salvador, Honduras, or Guatemala in time to deter their youth from leaving right now is ludicrous.In the words of the State Department’s senior Latin American official in 2019, “This approach failed.” There is no realistic correlation between U.S. aid dollars spent in Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and any reduction in illegal crossings of our border by the targeted nations, much less from places such as Eritrea and India, which the “root causes” aid spigot does not even touch.Meanwhile, as the report makes clear, former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents programs were essentially amnesty by the slow boat, adding to the factors pulling illegal migrants into the U.S.Just as “Justice delayed is justice denied,” so too action on immigration deferred, whether by Temporary Protected Status, humanitarian parole, or deliberate lack of prosecution, is amnesty in practice.With an official policy of “prosecutorial discretion” not to deport them, work authorization, schooling for their children, health care in emergency rooms, and even driver’s licenses and “free” in-state college tuition in many states, illegal residents of the U.S are highly incentivized to stay.The Biden administration came to power with an open-borders mentality, determined to undo everything former President Donald Trump had done to control the border. Biden ended the successful Migrant Protection Protocols, which, by sending would-be illegal immigrants back into Mexico while their cases were decided, deterred fraudulent and frivolous asylum claims by economic migrants.Biden also ended the promising Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Northern Triangle countries, and through regulatory overreach and prosecutorial discretion—which in practice means telling prosecutors not to do their jobs—undid efforts to streamline the asylum-processing system.U.S. immigration courts already have 1.7 million pending cases, and that impossible backlog is rapidly increasing.The Biden regime is also determined to end Title 42, the health-related provision enacted by Trump because of COVID-19 that allows CBP to expel illegal immigrants before they can be admitted and claim asylum.The disdain with which this administration treats career border officials and agents who attempt to enforce the law is disgraceful, from Biden’s silence when Texas National Guardsman Bishop Evans died saving illegal immigrants from drowning to the White House’s refusal to apologize to mounted Border Patrol agents after falsely accusing them of using their reins to whip Haitians crossing into the U.S. illegally.The consequences of Biden’s abject refusal to enforce our immigration laws are obvious, if slow to unfurl. At current rates, the Biden border is allowing in enough illegal immigrants to fill a city the size of Houston or Chicago in a year. Among them, CBP will likely arrest more than 10,000 criminal aliens in 2022.How many made it through, while agents were pulled off the border to rubber-stamp “credible fear” claims that end in asylum applicants being released indefinitely? The Department of Homeland Security reported in 2017 that of the 89% of illegal migrants from the Northern Triangle who claimed asylum and then passed an initial “credible fear” screening, “more than half never applied for asylum after being released or failed to show for their initial hearing.”Seizures of drugs at the border are at record levels, but enough get through that more than 107,000 Americans died of overdoses last year.Despite the failure of Obama’s effort to stem the tide of illegal migrants by throwing money at “root causes,” according to the report, the Biden administration doubled down with its own Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of Migration in Central America.It’s the same idea: billions in deficit-funded U.S. tax money in an attempt to create functional democracies in the Northern Triangle. This being the Biden administration, it sprinkled the plan with terms such as “community-based solutions” and “safe spaces,” and added climate change and “sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence” to the list of problems to solve, but it’s essentially the same program as Obama’s and will achieve as little.What we can’t do is clear. “The United States is not responsible for solving the transnational crime, migration management, and border security issues in Mexico and northern Central America,” the report concludes.What the administration can do, the senators recommend, is “use all available tools to secure the border” right now, including Title 42 and the Migrant Protection Protocols.In the longer term, they recommend targeting U.S. assistance to “strengthen the capacity, funding, and staffing of migration management and law enforcement agencies” in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to process refugees there, and signing Asylum Cooperative Agreements or similar undertakings with them to stem the flow into the U.S.The senators also recommend working with our southern neighbors to prosecute the organized criminals who are making money through the misery of both migrants and the tens of thousands of Americans who overdose annually on drugs smuggled in through Mexico.There’s even more to be done, as outlined in a May 2022 joint letter to Congress from independent public policy groups, including The Heritage Foundation, former Trump administration officials, and others.Those measures would reestablish the successful “Remain in Mexico” agreement, correct regulatory overreach, limit prosecutorial discretion, and generally get control of the border through proper enforcement of existing laws.Only once the border is no longer an unmitigated chaos can the country begin to think about reforming immigration laws in the greater national interest.Until then, warming over the cold hash of foreign aid and social justice programs that have been tried and failed before is only going to make Americans poorer, less safe, and less confident in their government’s ability to protect them.To read this story on the Daily Signal website, click here. Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/senate-republicans-report-condemns-biden-s-border-crisis"

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/gop-senators-issue-scathing-report-biden-to-blame-for-monumental-levels-of-illegal-immigration,"The report blames Biden’s policies for the more than 2.6 million border crossers and illegal aliens that have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border since January 2021.Sens. James Risch (R-ID), John Barrasso (R-WY), Rob Portman (R-OH), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Todd Young (R-IN), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) authored the report, writing:The illegal migration crisis at the U.S. southern border presents a national security threat and a humanitarian catastrophe for the vulnerable people involved. Illegal migration to the United States has reached monumental levels since the Biden administration entered office. Since January 2021, U.S. law enforcement has encountered over 2.6 million migrants trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico, northern Central America, and countries beyond. On average, over 171,840 migrants have sought to enter the United States illegally per month during this period, with the highest monthly total reaching 234,088 in April 2022. [Emphasis added]Specifically, the Senators write that while former President Trump’s border controls — such as the Remain in Mexico program and safe third country agreements — had proven to drastically cut illegal immigration, Biden ended the policies, spurring waves of illegal immigration not seen since former President Bill Clinton’s administration.The Senators write:In 2014, President Barack Obama took a series of executive actions which ultimately incentivized illegal migration. These initiatives included expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; creating a Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program; and expanding use of provisional waivers for unlawful presence. In effect, these policies incentivized waves of illegal migration to the United States. In the years that followed, President Obama presided over a calamitous illegal migration crisis involving thousands of unaccompanied children. The Obama administration ignored years of warnings and mounting evidence about the impending crisis, and then ineffectively responded as it rushed to minimize the political cost of the tragic situation. [Emphasis added]In the wake of this bad policy, the Trump administration took a series of actions to effectively stem the flow of illegal migration and build political will in neighboring countries to improve their law enforcement and asylum processing capacity. Unfortunately, the Biden administration prematurely dismantled these measures, failed to put in place workable alternatives, and doubled down on the reckless policies of the Obama administration responsible for earlier surges in illegal migration. These policies send a potent signal of lawlessness at the southern border of the United States. Such dangerous signals overwhelm already weak border security and migration management capabilities in Mexico and northern Central America and discourage our neighbors from taking action to improve these critical functions across their own national territories. [Emphasis added]As policy prescriptions, the Senators write that Biden ought to continue extending the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Title 42 authority that allows Border Patrol agents to quickly return illegal aliens to Mexico, reinstate the Remain in Mexico program, and reimpose all safe third country agreements that Trump had previously negotiated with Central America.Those agreements ensure that border crossers passing through Mexico to claim asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border must first seek asylum in Mexico, a nation with a robust asylum process. The agreements, as intended, are meant to end asylum shopping. The U.S. has a similar agreement with Canada.“Failure to make meaningful progress in these areas will severely undermine the capacity of U.S. law enforcement to protect our nation’s borders and the safety of communities,” the Senators write.As Breitbart News chronicles, a caravan of more than 7,100 border crossers and illegal aliens is reaching the U.S.-Mexico border every day at current rates. In May, alone, that more than 222,000 border crossers and illegal aliens were encountered at the border.Meanwhile, from February 2021 to May 2022, the Biden administration has released more than 1.05 million border crossers and illegal aliens into the U.S. interior — twice the population of Wyoming, larger than the population of Austin, Texas, and twice the population of Atlanta, Georgia.To read this article on the Breitbart website, click here. Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/gop-senators-issue-scathing-report-biden-to-blame-for-monumental-levels-of-illegal-immigration"

In order to protect U.S. security and regional stability, its time the administration establish sound immigration controls within the United States and build political will and capacity in Mexico and the northern Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member James Risch, R-Idaho, told Fox News Digital.  ""Our report offers concrete recommendations to address the root causes of illegal migration and to achieve safety and security at our U.S. southern border and the region at large.""The report drew a connection between the policies of the Obama administration and those implemented by the Biden administration, highlighting how Biden’s policies ""incentivized illegal migration and undermined the ability of U.S. law enforcement to secure our borders."" Specifically, the report called out Biden’s attempt to end Title 42 and focus on the ""root causes"" of illegal immigration as some of the factors contributing to the crisis at the border. Biden appointed Vice President Kamala Harris in 2021 to lead his administration’s efforts to solve the issue of illegal immigration, and she has since focused the administration’s efforts on the ""root causes"" of migration.""As the president has said, there are many factors that lead [migrants] to leave these countries,"" Harris said at the time. ""While we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also, because we can chew gum and walk at the same time, must address the root causes that cause people to make the treck."" These policies have been taken advantage of by transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), the report stated, which profit from smuggling drugs and humans across the southern border. The report also highlighted how ""transnational crime, migration management, and border security issues"" in Mexico and Central America have contributed to the influx of illegal immigrants on the southern border. ""The Biden Administration’s disastrous immigration and border policies, combined with the growing numbers of outward migration from the Western Hemisphere and TCOs’ evolving human smuggling and trafficking tactics, have a detrimental impact on the safety and security of the United States,"" the report read. The report called on the Biden administration to take several steps to stem the flow of illegal immigration across the southern border, beginning with strengthening border security. ""Not only will stronger immigration controls protect our own national borders, but they will signal U.S. political will to meaningly address illegal immigration to governments in the region, and signal to TCOs and would-be illegal migrants that they cannot illegally enter the United States with impunity,"" it read. The United States should also work with Mexico and Central America to improve regional security and migration management, the report stated. ""This would reduce the burden on U.S. law enforcement at the southern border, while promoting safe, orderly, and legal migration throughout the region,"" it read. Along with Risch, co-signers on the report included Sens.

Their benefits far outweigh arguments for their removal.Not even two years ago, the federal government completed a comprehensive and scientific multi-year study of the lower Snake River dams. The study’s findings were clear: the lower Snake River dams should not be breached.Yet last week, Washington State Democrats heralded a draft report – one they had paid for – on breaching the dams.Instead of the federal study’s four years, their report took six months.Instead of the federal study’s experts, their report was conducted by political consultants.The results of an unscientific and politically-motivated review of cherry-picked information do not concern me.Saving Northwest salmon is a worthy goal, and I welcome actual collaboration to improve salmon populations. But spending billions of dollars to blow up critical infrastructure is a nonstarter.I remain flatly opposed to dam breaching.Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/icymi-risch-flatly-opposed-to-dam-breaching"

I’m proud to join my colleague from Oklahoma in introducing this common sense legislation.”“The fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking number of illegal border crossings from last year is alarming and intolerable,” Crapo said. “We must close this loophole and protect national security by enforcing all immigration laws to ensure the safety of American citizens.”“Our immigration system is broken and President Biden won’t acknowledge the crisis we are facing at the southern border,” Inhofe said. “That’s why my colleagues and I introduced the Keep Our Communities Safe Act this week. This legislation would close the ‘catch-and-release’ loophole, which puts law abiding citizens, local law enforcement officials and communities at risk. Our bill will ensure that illegal aliens who have been found guilty of violent crimes and aggravated felonies are not able to remain in our communities. As the current law stands, an illegal alien with a criminal record is released back into the United States after six months if no other country accepts them for deportation. This bill is a commonsense solution and it’s time for it to become law.”The Keep Our Communities Safe Act closes the loophole that prevents DHS from detaining non-removable immigrants beyond the current Supreme Court-mandated six months in these specific situations:Additional cosponsors of the Keep Our Communities Safe Act include Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.).Full text of the bill can be found here. # # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/risch-crapo-inhofe-introduce-bill-to-close-catch-and-release-loophole"

It would also direct DOI to finalize a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan.The second bill, the Opportunities for the Nation and States to Harness Onshore Resources for Energy (ONSHORE) Act, would empower states to manage the development and production of oil and gas on federal lands within their borders.Additional cosponsors of these bills are Senators John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.).“Since day one, President Biden has failed to take full advantage of America’s abundant energy supply. This inaction has resulted in record prices at the pump and negotiations with dictators and despots in unfriendly nations,” said Risch. “These bills unleash some of our nation’s greatest assets while increasing energy production, creating jobs, invigorating our economy, and strengthening our national security. The consistent sale of gas and oil leases and timely approvals of drilling permits will help set America on a path to becoming energy independent.”“The Biden administration’s relentless war on American energy must end. It has led to sky-high energy prices and has emboldened our enemies,” said Barrasso. “My legislation will boost production and development of American energy. The Lease Now Act will ensure the administration resumes and maintains consistent oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and waters. It will also direct DOI to finalize plans for future oil and gas lease sales. The ONSHORE Act empowers states with the authority to manage oil and gas permitting and regulatory responsibilities on federal land within their borders.

It was also cosponsored by 82 additional Senate colleagues.“Our law enforcement and their families deserve our recognition and support for their brave work protecting and serving our communities,” said Risch. “I am deeply grateful to the more than 800,000 law enforcement officers across the country who put their personal safety on the line every day to keep us safe.”“We all must recognize the important role police officers have in making our communities safe and show support for police and law enforcement personnel,” said Crapo. “They need our support perhaps now more than ever.”The resolution honors the 576 law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2021, including nearly 400 who died from COVID-19, as well as the 92 lost to date in 2022. Last year marked the most intentional killings of police since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In the face of an ongoing pandemic and rise in violent crime, law enforcement personnel continue to answer the call, serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves.The resolution designates the week of May 15 through May 21, 2022, as “National Police Week,” and expresses unwavering support for law enforcement officers across the United States in the pursuit of preserving safe and secure communities.Text the resolution is available HERE.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/senate-commemorates-national-police-week"

I’m glad to see this initial shipment of fresh Idaho potatoes granted access to Mexico, but this needs to be the first step of many,” said Risch. “Potato growers in Idaho and across the country were promised meaningful market access more than 15 years ago, and Mexico has a responsibility to make good on its pledge to our farmers.”“Thanks to commitments made under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, (USMCA), U.S. fresh potatoes now have full market access in Mexico, and a shipment of Idaho potatoes was cleared to enter the country,” said Crapo. “Addressing this decades-long dispute is a significant step forward in improving and strengthening our trade relationship with Mexico. While this is a positive development, we must continue to monitor Mexico’s compliance with USMCA to ensure every aspect is fully enforced and the agreement lives up to its full potential.”While Mexico is the largest market for U.S. potatoes, until now, imports of fresh U.S. potatoes have been limited to a roughly 16 mile area along the U.S.-Mexico border. The U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement late last year to expand market access for U.S. potatoes, something that the United States has actively sought for more than 15 years. The National Potato Council (NPC) estimates full market potential for fresh table potatoes could reach $250 million a year.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/risch-crapo-applaud-full-market-access-for-idaho-potatoes-in-mexico"

If implemented, this new rule would require gun kits and gun parts to be regulated as if they were fully functional firearms, meaning they would not be able to be sold without a serial number or without the buyer undergoing a background check. The new rule would also require those with Federal Firearms Licenses to retain records permanently, in effect creating a national firearms registry. The current rule, which the Biden administration seeks to change, allows for the disposal of records after 20 years.  According to the Government Accountability Office, “The CRA allows Congress to review ‘major’ rules issued by federal agencies before the rules take effect. Congress may also disapprove new rules, resulting in the rules having no force or effect.”Additional co-sponsors of the resolution include Senators James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Mike Braun (R-Indiana), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Steve Daines (R-Montana), Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), Kevin Cramer (R-North Dakota), John Thune (R-South Dakota), Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming), John Boozman (R-Arkansas), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), John Barrasso (R-Wyoming), James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), John Hoeven (R-North Dakota), Josh Hawley (R-Arkansas), Tom Tillis (R-North Carolina), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky).Read the resolution here.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-crapo-oppose-biden-doj-expanding-firearm-definitions-and-creating-national-gun-registry"

Jim Risch introduced its companion bill in the Senate, which was co-sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo. Reps. Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson, both Republicans, signed on as co-sponsors of the House bill nearly a year ago.Digitizing publicly available records will end the days of reaching a trailhead only to find it’s closed, and reduce trespassing on private land, Risch in a statement to the Idaho Statesman.“Now that the MAPLand Act is law, I look forward to seeing my fellow Idahoans take full advantage of these modernized records and explore all that Idaho’s vast public lands have to offer,” Risch said.The data publication is slated to be completed within the next four years.The legislation earned bipartisan support, with just nine lawmakers voting against it in the House. The Senate passed the act unanimously. Local and national outdoor recreation and conservation groups have lauded the effort.“We appreciate the leadership shown by Idaho’s congressional delegation in seeing the MAPLand Act through to the finish line,” said Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, in a statement. “Hunters and anglers as well as our partners in the outdoor industry have been vocal champions of the MAPLand Act since it was first introduced, because we know that this common-sense investment will empower more people to get outside and discover new recreational opportunities.”Brian Brooks, head of the Idaho Wildlife Federation and a longtime proponent of public land access, said the digitized information will be a boon to Idahoans. “So many of these records weren’t digitized, and they’re in old dusty bins in back offices across the state,” Brooks told the Statesman. “This is a great resource to use some technology to have a one-stop shop and say, ‘Here’s where I can go.’""Studies in recent years have shown that thousands of acres of public land in Idaho are inaccessible. Brooks said revisiting records, particularly of easements, could unlock access to some of that acreage.To read this article on the Idaho Statesman website, click here. Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/biden-signs-bill-touted-by-idaho-congressmen-aims-to-make-public-land-access-easier-read-more-at-https-www-idahostatesman-com-outdoors-article260909412-html-storylink-cpy"

Text of the legislation may be found here.“The Administration has created a ‘Disinformation Board’ in the name of protecting the U.S. from threats. However, the real threat to our democracy is giving unelected bureaucrats the power to chill free speech,” said Risch. “I will continue to defend our Constitutional right to freedom of speech and support legislation to defund acts of government overreach that trample our American principles.”“Idahoans are rightfully concerned with the Administration’s latest attempts to brazenly establish a federal propaganda panel under the guise of countering disinformation,” said Crapo.  “If the Administration truly intended to counter disinformation threats to national security, it would not have established this so-called Disinformation Governance Board under a months-long veil of secrecy.  This Orwellian Ministry of Truth effort is an unconstitutional waste of taxpayer dollars and a threat to free speech.  The Administration should stop playing games and focus on securing our southern border, addressing skyrocketing inflation and reducing its excessive overreach into the lives of Americans.”“The Biden administration wants a government agency dedicated to cracking down on what its subjects can say, an idea popular with Orwellian governments everywhere. This board is unconstitutional and un-American—my bill puts a stop to it,” said Cotton.Additional cosponsors of the legislation include: Senators John Boozman (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/risch-crapo-join-effort-to-defund-homeland-security-s-disinformation-board"

This legislation will digitize and standardize mapping records, like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, to boost outdoor recreation and improve hunting and fishing access for sportsmen and women.“Digitizing publicly available records will end the days of reaching a trailhead only to find it is already closed for the season or being unsure where an access point is located. It will also help reduce trespassing on private land by showing new public land users where they can and cannot go,” said Senator Risch. “Now that the MAPLand Act is law, I look forward to seeing my fellow Idahoans take full advantage of these modernized records and explore all that Idaho’s vast public lands have to offer.”“America’s public lands are among our nation’s greatest treasures and have given people from around the world unparalleled access the natural beauty that surrounds us. As the call of the wild grows even stronger for many, we must continue to modernize access to the great outdoors,” said Senator King. “This bipartisan law will make it easier for Americans of all ages to experience our natural treasures, and for hunters, fishers, and adventurers to recreate safely using the latest mapping technologies. I’m grateful that President Biden has signed this important bipartisan legislation into law, and look forward to seeing how these changes provide new benefits for our nation’s outdoor enthusiasts.”Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) also applauded the enactment of the MAPLand Act.“I am thrilled the President has signed this important legislation into law to improve public knowledge of outdoor recreation opportunities and promote increased access to our country’s breathtaking public lands and natural resources.

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/idaho-delegation-state-treasurer-announce-secure-rural-schools-payments,"BOISE, Idaho – Idaho’s U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Representatives Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher (all R-Idaho) and State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth announced Idaho counties will receive a total of $23.4 million in payments for Fiscal Year 2021 under the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program. Under Idaho law, 30 percent of the SRS funding goes to counties to help with schools and the remaining 70 percent is earmarked for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. That means Idaho schools will receive roughly $7 million, and Idaho roads and other county projects will receive roughly $16.4 million for FY 2021.The U.S. Forest Service, and in some cases, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management administer the funds. The totals are based on a formula that takes into account economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary from county to county. SRS payments are critical to maintain education programs for many rural counties that contain federal lands exempt from property taxes.  Idaho received the third-highest total in the U.S., behind California and Oregon.“I’m pleased we were able to secure this SRS funding for Idaho’s rural counties, but more needs to be done,” said Senator Risch. “The federal government has an obligation to the communities that count on the SRS program. We owe it to them to find a lasting solution.” “This funding is so valuable to our rural schools and infrastructure. My office looks forward to getting these dollars into the hands of our Idaho counties to further opportunities for our rural areas,” said Idaho Treasurer Julie Ellsworth. “A big thank you to Senators Crapo and Risch as well as Congressmen Simpson and Fulcher for securing this appropriation for Idaho.”“SRS payments are essential for rural counties across Idaho and the West, but a permanent solution is needed,” said Senator Crapo. “Adequate funding for schools, roads and infrastructure repair will only be guaranteed once we can reach agreement on a self-contained funding mechanism outside the yearly votes in Congress, and we are working toward the goal of a more permanent solution.”“SRS payments are critical in funding Idaho schools and infrastructure, and I am pleased to see this funding come to our state,” said Representative Simpson. “This is essentially the federal government’s property tax for counties where there are large amounts of federal land. If you don’t have the ability to collect local property taxes, these programs are necessary to provide funding for schools, roads, and other local services – especially in Idaho’s rural counties.”“For years, local governments and schools in rural counties in Idaho have experienced strained budgets due to immense federal land ownership in the West,” said Representative Fulcher. “These areas take a big hit because so much of the land in their jurisdiction is not taxable. While this year’s funding is positive, the short-term nature of these announcements can cause issues for these communities and schools in making long-term plans. Looking forward, it is imperative that Congress prioritize a long-term, predictable solution for PILT and SRS to assist these counties.”For more information about the administration of public funds by the State Treasurer’s Office (STO), visit the STO’s website HERE. # # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/idaho-delegation-state-treasurer-announce-secure-rural-schools-payments"
https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-crapo-demand-answers-on-changes-to-border-security-policies,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo (both R-Idaho) joined Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and 10 of their colleagues in seeking answers from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on recent changes to how the department enforces border security and processes migrants at the southern border.“In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single year total ever recorded,” the senators wrote . “Even more troubling is the fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers from last year.”“The Biden administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the latest example of troubling policy moves,” the senators continued. “Last year, Title 42 was used more than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals who crossed the border illegally. Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and law enforcement along the border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of sustained record levels of illegal crossings.”The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa).The full letter can be found HERE and below.Dear Secretary Mayorkas:We write today to express our grave concerns with actions taken by the Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the effect they will have on our ability to secure our southern border. These concerns are exacerbated as it becomes more likely every day that this year we will surpass the record-breaking number of encounters at the southern border experienced last year.In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 1.7 million encounters with individuals attempting to cross the border illegally, the highest single year total ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that this year is on pace to far exceed the record-breaking numbers from last year. In February, CBP recorded nearly 165,000 encounters, setting a record for that particular month and marking the twelfth month in a row in which encounters exceeded 150,000.Securing the southern border and deterring the sustained, record-breaking flow of illegal and irregular migration should be a top priority for DHS. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has done the opposite by instituting policies that encourage individuals to make the dangerous trek north and entrust their safety to dangerous drug cartels at the risk of being murdered, assaulted or trafficked.In September of last year, you issued new guidance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for its enforcement and removal operations which dramatically limited the scope of individuals ICE prioritizes for enforcement. With the publication of the ICE Annual Report last month, we learned the results of this policy and, as expected, they are extremely disconcerting as both arrests and removals reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Even more troubling is the fact that arrests and removals of those convicted of a crime were down 48% and 63%, respectively.More recently, your department has moved to dramatically alter America’s system for granting asylum by striping immigration judges of decision-making authority and giving it to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers. Such a move raises serious red flags, given that 85% of determinations of credible fear by a USCIS asylum officers are later overturned by an immigration judge.Finally, the Biden administration’s decision to terminate the Title 42 public health order that provided border agents the authority to perform expedited removals is the latest example of troubling policy moves. Last year, Title 42 was used more than 1 million times to quickly expel individuals who crossed the border illegally. Such a move will undoubtedly leave CBP and law enforcement along the border vulnerable to being overwhelmed in the face of sustained record levels of illegal crossings. It has been reported that there are some 25,000 individuals already waiting in Mexico for Title 42 to be lifted and US intelligence estimates an influx of more than 170,000 total.It’s clear that the humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border will not slow in the coming months and is on pace to be even worse. We understand DHS is actively preparing to respond to the increased illegal and irregular migration, but more details of the plans are needed. We ask that you answer the following questions by April 27, 2022.Addressing the problems facing our broken immigration system in order to provide an effective and efficient legal pathway for those who wish to share in and contribute to the success of our great nation is, as it should be, a priority. However, this cannot be accomplished until we are able to properly secure our borders. Thank you for your attention to this request, and we look forward to your reply.Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-crapo-demand-answers-on-changes-to-border-security-policies"

Led by U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Angus King (I-Maine), with additional support from Energy and Natural Resource Committee Chairman Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Ranking Member John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), will enhance access to our nation’s outdoor recreational opportunities.“I am proud to see this commonsense legislation make its way to the President,” said Senator Risch. “The MAPLand Act will not only make it easier than ever for outdoorsmen and women to explore and recreate on Idaho’s vast public lands, but for them to do so legally and responsibly.”“America’s public lands have always enabled our citizens to get outside to explore the natural beauty that surrounds us – and in recent years, the call of the wild has grown even stronger for people across our nation,” said Senator King. “Our bipartisan legislation will make it easier for America’s hunters, fishers, and adventurers to recreate safely, using the latest mapping technologies to help more Americans access our public lands. I’m grateful that this legislation has passed through Congress with strong bipartisan support, and look forward to seeing how it supports our nation’s outdoor enthusiasts.”“As Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a lifelong outdoorsman, I’ve long championed initiatives to increase access to our country’s stunning public lands and natural resources. I am therefore incredibly proud to see the Senate pass our common sense, bipartisan legislation that further pursues this mission. By providing our federal land management agencies with the resources to collect and digitize public land mapping records, we will improve public knowledge of outdoor recreation opportunities with up to date information and help our sportsmen and women better navigate the wild and wonderful outdoor playground we’ve been blessed with,” said Chairman Manchin.“Congress has passed legislation that will allow America’s sportsmen and women easy access to digital maps of our public lands and waters,” said Ranking Member Barrasso. “The bill will help fishermen, hunters, and hikers to easily plan their adventures. The people of Wyoming understand the importance of promoting outdoor access while ensuring private property rights are protected. The MAP Land Act will do just that by clarifying the roads and trails outdoor enthusiasts can use.”Background: Every year, hunters, anglers, and outdoorsmen miss out on opportunities to recreate on public lands because the only maps showing access points are stored as printed copies in local field offices. The MAPLand Act will digitize and standardize mapping records, like access points and permissible uses on federal public lands, to boost outdoor recreation and improve hunting and fishing access for sportsmen and women.The MAPLand Act has received strong support from the sportsmen and outdoor recreation communities:“Last night's passage of the MAPLand Act is a huge win in ensuring that our public lands system is accessible to all Americans, and we are grateful to Senators Risch and King for their leadership on this important issue,” said Whit Fosburgh, President and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “Hunters and anglers as well as our partners in the outdoor industry have been vocal champions of this common-sense legislation since it was first introduced, because we know that a 21st-century digital mapping system for our public lands will empower more people to get outside and discover new recreational opportunities.”“Digital mapping and GPS technologies have revolutionized the ways in which sportsmen and women navigate public lands and waters. Unfortunately, incomplete and inconsistent information often prevents hunters, anglers, and recreational shooters from fully utilizing the benefits of these technologies,” said Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF) President and CEO Jeff Crane. “CSF applauds Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus (CSC) past Co-Chair Sen. Risch, current CSC Leaders Sens. Heinrich and Manchin, and other bipartisan Senators for championing this important legislation.”“The No. 1 reason for hunter decline in the U.S. is insufficient public access and quality hunting opportunities. The importance of reliable, comprehensive information on access to our public lands and waters cannot be overstated. The need to modernize mapping systems is also critical for improving active management of fish and wildlife habitat and developing better data and science for understanding things like migration corridors. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers thanks Senator Risch and the congressional leaders in both chambers who championed this foresighted, commonsense effort,” said Land Tawney, CEO of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.“Quality hunting and fishing requires healthy habitat and access for hunters and anglers. The #MAPLandAct makes sure that information about public land access and areas open for hunting and fishing is kept current and readily available for sportsmen and women,” said Steve Kandell, Director of Trout Unlimited's Angler Conservation Program.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-king-bill-to-modernize-public-land-mapping-heads-to-president-s-desk"

Since Malvagio’s opened its doors in 2016, it has become a mainstay of the Coeur d’Alene community, with its cuisine making appearances at weddings, parties, and celebrations across North Idaho.Malvagio’s success is matched only by the Petersens’ dedication to giving back. As the world watched Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Svitlana, a Ukrainian native, and Matthew began serving borscht, an authentic Ukrainian dish, donating all proceeds to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. Malvagio’s has raised thousands of dollars in support of Ukraine and has become a champion of Idahoan entrepreneurship and philanthropy along the way.“Svitlana and Matthew are using their platform to make a difference in people’s lives halfway across the world,” said Risch. “Their commitment to North Idaho and dedication to a worthy cause is beyond commendable, and I thank them for their contribution.”“Congratulations to Malvagio’s Restaurant and its employees on being the Idaho Small Business of the Month for April 2022,” Risch continued. “You make our great state proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.”Background: Idaho is consistently ranked one of the best places in the country to do business. Each month, Senator Risch selects an Idaho small business that exemplifies the Idaho values of hard work, entrepreneurial spirit, and exceptional commitment to community.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-names-malvagio-s-restaurant-as-the-april-small-business-of-the-month"
https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-leads-bill-to-reduce-federal-regulations,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch introduced the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act to limit federal overreach and reduce federal spending. This bill requires agencies to repeal two existing regulations for each new significant regulation issued. The ‘one-in, two-out’ method codifies a 2017 Trump-era executive order to weed out old, unnecessary, and inefficient regulations. Agencies will be required to initiate simpler, cost-saving regulations which will benefit the federal government, small businesses, and American taxpayers.Cosponsors of the legislation include U.S. Senators Mike Crapo, Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and Mike Braun (R-Ind.).“Idaho has been on the leading edge of cutting red tape, but federal spending and regulations continue to have far-reaching effects on Idaho small businesses and taxpayers,” said Senator Risch. “The federal government should follow Idaho’s lead in reducing costly and burdensome regulations with this effective one-in, two-out rule.”“Idaho’s recent deregulation efforts have strengthened its position as a magnet for ingenuity, growth and free enterprise,” said Senator Crapo. “The federal government should follow suit, take a hard look at its laundry list of regulations and get rid of those that are mere power grabs that drown American innovation in paperwork and inefficiency. We must continue to do more to stop federal control from creeping into more aspects of our lives.”“President Trump took the right approach when he required federal agencies to eliminate burdensome and wasteful regulations on businesses and taxpayers,” said Senator Hagerty. “Making this practical ‘one-in, two-out’ method permanent will free American workers and business owners from overregulation that stifles innovation, jobs, and wages, allowing the private sector to grow—not the government from a sclerotic regulatory approach.”“Increasing government efficiency by cutting red tape is one of the many tools in our belt to combat the painful results of the Biden economic agenda. We need to rein in the bureaucracy so that taxpayer dollars are not being wasted on regulations that only make it harder for America’s small business owners to thrive,” said Senator Scott.“The bureaucracy of the federal government is expansive, and the cost of complying with these regulations is burdensome for Americans,” said Senator Moran. “This legislation would require federal agencies to reduce regulations on American businesses instead of piling more rules on top of existing regulations.”“I ran a business for 37 years in my hometown, and I know firsthand that small businesses and entrepreneurs are bogged down in regulations that aren’t all that effective at anything but slowing down job creation. I support this one-in, two-out policy that would take the wet blanket off our economy,” said Senator Braun.Background: Idaho is the least regulated state in the country. In one of his first acts in office, Governor Brad Little spearheaded the Red Tape Reduction Act, which required state agencies to simplify or repeal two existing rules for each new rule proposed. Cutting red tape has been key to Idaho’s success, and it is past time the federal government follows Idaho’s lead.What others are saying:“In Idaho, we’ve taken an axe to state regulations for three straight years. We’ve cut or simplified 95-percent of red tape, and we’re not done yet. We’ve seen the results first-hand: when you remove regulatory friction, good jobs follow. Idaho’s economy outpaces every other state in the nation. I applaud Senator Risch for bringing the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act to rein in the Biden administration’s penchant for adding regulations that amount to little more than rocks in the shoes of small businesses. Washington, D.C., could learn a thing or two from Idaho, and this Act will help create jobs and save taxpayer dollars,” said Idaho Governor Brad Little.“Instead of focusing on solutions to get the inflation crisis under control, the Biden administration continues to pour gasoline on the fire by pushing out regulation after regulation that will only serve to drive up costs for American families while protecting politically favored industries. Fortunately, Senator Risch is introducing the  Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, which would put everyday Americans first by holding the administration’s feet to the fire and forcing them to cut harmful regulations,”  said Garrett Bess, Vice President of Heritage Action.""FreedomWorks thanks Senator Risch for introducing this important legislation and urges every Senator to become a co-sponsor. Our regulatory state has grown out of control. Unelected bureaucrats impose massive burdens on our economy, and stifle growth and innovation with costly regulations. If you were to accumulate the economic losses created by regulations, the costs total about four trillion dollars, more than most global economies. In a world that is rapidly advancing and innovating, we cannot afford to hamstring our nation’s businesses this way. Legislation like this is crucial to holding the Biden administration accountable, and re-asserting the legislative branch’s proper Article I authority,"" said Adam Brandon, President of FreedomWorks.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/4/risch-leads-bill-to-reduce-federal-regulations"

This bill will expand Title 42 authority to turn back migrants to combat prolific drug smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.More than 10,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized and over 1 million migrants expelled at the southern border during Fiscal Year 2021, while Title 42 was in effect. Title 42, which the Administration is preparing to end by May 23, 2022, currently only allows for the expulsion of migrants during the spread of communicable diseases. “President Biden refuses to address the flow of fentanyl across our southern border and into our communities,” said Risch. “This bill will protect Idaho from experiencing the dual impacts of the immigration crisis and drug use crisis, spurred by the Administration’s open border policies.”“The soaring increase in drug overdose deaths in the last year is a public health crisis,” said Crapo. “Mexico is a major source of the illicit flow of fentanyl into the United States, and more must be done to stop this deadly substance from entering the country. This bill will help address the public health crisis facilitated by drug smuggling and enable our enforcement authorities on the border to keep a tighter grip on the record-breaking flow of illegal border crossings.”# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/risch-crapo-introduce-legislation-to-combat-surge-of-illicit-drugs-across-southern-border"

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/risch-leads-legislation-to-prevent-labor-union-slowdowns,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch introduced the Preventing Labor Union Slowdowns (PLUS) Act to protect our national supply chain during upcoming maritime union negotiations. During past negotiations, maritime labor unions employed a “slowdown” tactic instead of striking, which causes substantial losses for local businesses importing and exporting goods. The PLUS Act would protect local businesses by amending federal law to define a labor slowdown as an unfair labor practice.Additional cosponsors of the PLUS Act include U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.).“American businesses have experienced severe hardships and costs caused by ongoing supply chain disruptions. For an Idaho exporter, every additional day their goods are stuck in port costs them thousands of dollars,” said Risch. “As labor negotiations at ports get underway, the PLUS Act will ensure businesses are not held hostage and left to foot the bill if a labor dispute occurs.”“Idaho’s businesses have experienced unfair and significant losses due to port slowdowns in the past,” said Crapo. “Slowdown practices have the potential to negatively impact the competitiveness of Idaho commodities globally for years to come. This bill will enable Idaho’s business community to remain competitive when faced with labor disputes outside the state and out of our control.”Scott said, “Families are experiencing the highest inflation rates our nation has seen in generations, and America’s stifled supply chain is only compounding the financial stress Floridians and all Americans are facing. Government should be making it as easy as possible to transport everyday goods that people need – especially as prices continue to skyrocket and shelves remain empty. This is why we must pass the PLUS Act so we can cut red tape, keep workers on the job and prevent supply chain disruptions. I urge my colleagues to support this good bill.”“Idaho’s farmers and ranchers are facing the highest input costs they have seen in decades. Agriculture depends on efficient ports to feed the world and receive materials to effectively grow our food and fiber. Unfair practices by labor unions, including not implementing technologies to improve port efficiencies, are adding another layer of burden and cost to America’s farmers during these times,” said Idaho Farm Bureau President Bryan Searle. “Such actions by unions will continue to have a negative impact, not only on this country’s agricultural producers but on everyday consumers who work to feed their families. The Idaho Farm Bureau applauds Sen. Risch for introducing the PLUS Act, and we encourage Congress’s serious consideration of the bill.” “In 2015, union slowdown practices at the Port of Portland essentially ended container on barge service on the Columbia Snake River System. The PLUS Act would help prevent the hardship Idaho agricultural and timber interests face due to the loss of barge service,” said Dave Doeringsfeld, General Manager of the Port of Lewiston, Idaho.Background: Labor unions’ “slowdown” tactic hurts port managers because remuneration for full benefits and salaries is required, and replacing or firing employees cannot occur. The U.S. Potato Board estimates that during previous negotiations, west coast slowdowns caused massive financial damage to the food industry, including a $50 million loss to the Idaho potato industry. Other estimates include $70 million in wasted fruit in Washington, and $40 million per week loss in meat sales.The PLUS Act would change the National Labor Relations Act to define a labor slowdown by maritime workers as an unfair labor practice. The bill also makes it an unfair labor practice for labor unions to block modernization efforts at ports and specifies that refusing to work automated vessels is an unfair labor practice.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/risch-leads-legislation-to-prevent-labor-union-slowdowns"

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/opinion-why-ukraine-matters,"Guest Column Submitted by U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho)Vladimir Putin is a madman. He is a thug. He is a power-hungry criminal with no regard for the rule of law or human life.Americans are disgusted by the atrocities Putin is inflicting on the Ukrainian people, but we do not want to get sucked in to another foreign war. In this critical hour, the United States can lead without putting U.S. boots on the ground.This war has broader implications than just those for Ukraine. With much hanging in the balance, it’s important to understand how we got here and what this military conflict means for the future of American leadership in the world.When America won the Cold War and the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine regained its independence. However, since Vladimir Putin first took power in Russia in 2000, he has attempted to rebuild the Soviet Empire and erode Ukraine’s sovereignty. Putin has consistently called Ukraine “Russian territory” and meddled in the country’s internal affairs.Putin’s goal is simple: he is determined to reach across Russia’s borders and swallow up former Soviet states he believes are the property of Russia. With this in mind, he has spent the last 15 years menacing Eastern Europe and creating chaos in democracies around the world.He has sent his henchmen after his enemies, kidnapping and poisoning them abroad. He has levied disruptive cyber-attacks on Estonia. He invaded Georgia in 2008 and took two provinces. In 2014, he crippled Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, then invaded and seized the Crimean Peninsula. So when open source intelligence showed Russian troops arriving at Ukraine’s border in ever greater numbers last year, the likelihood of a Russian invasion became a near certainty. Taken in isolation, this David and Goliath contest has immense implications for the Ukrainian people. Ukrainians have shown their resolve to defend and die for their freedoms and sovereignty, just as the American people did in 1776. However, the stakes of this war are much higher than this conflict alone, and China is closely watching how we respond to Russia’s aggression.A rising China and resurgent Russia are challenging the United States for dominance on the world stage. Xi and Putin want to impose their authoritarian power structure, norms and practices on the world. For them, this competition is a zero-sum game. If America shows weakness, they will press their advantage and pose a grave threat to America.The way we protect U.S. interests and stay out of this fight is by giving Ukrainians the tools to defend their sovereignty. Give Ukraine missiles. Give them airplanes. Give them humanitarian assistance. Give them equipment to defend themselves against Putin’s war machine, and do it faster. Their bravery shows they can do it on their own if supplied properly.   To that end, the Administration needs to stop dragging its feet. Congress has had to shame the Administration into every positive step it has taken. The Administration needs to stop reacting and start leading.This war is not just about Ukraine. The fight in Ukraine is a strategic challenge with long-term implications for the free world. Ukraine is the opening move in a game to tip the balance of power toward Russia and China to dominate the world for the next century or more. For the sake of our country and the sake of the free world, the Administration needs to get serious about supporting Ukraine with war-fighting materials so we can prevent a more sweeping conflict from coming to our shores.Ronald Reagan brought the Soviet Union crumbling down without ever firing a shot. We can do the same in this pivotal moment by arming Ukraine to defend its sovereignty so that freedom and democracy can flourish and prevail for decades to come.Word Count: 619Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/opinion-why-ukraine-matters"

This misguided policy deprioritizes the removal of dangerous criminal aliens—individuals who have been convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, and has resulted in further unnecessary victimization of American citizens.“The result has been predictable: By signaling that you will not enforce immigration laws, you have invited unprecedented increases in illegal border crossings. In 2021, CBP recorded over 2 million migrant encounters. According to CBP arrest data, the agency has arrested 2,424 criminal aliens so far in FY 2022. Although it is only March, this number is just 14 arrests shy of the total number of arrests in all of FY 2020. These individuals have been convicted of murder, rape, assault, robbery, weapons possession, and drug possession among other crimes. Your directive sends the unfortunate message that violating our country’s immigration laws is not a serious crime and will not result in any adverse civil legal actions.…“Under your leadership, the humanitarian crisis at our Southern border has spilled over into a crime wave impacting public safety for communities all across this nation. Strong enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws will act as a deterrent and help prevent additional tragic crimes in the future.“We urge you to reconsider the direction you are leading these agencies in and to immediately rescind your September 2021 guidance.”Read the full letter here. # # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/risch-crapo-colleagues-raise-crime-related-concerns-with-administration-s-de-prioritization-of-immigration"

The four dams generate approximately 1,000 megawatts of power on average annually, with the capacity for generating over 3,000 megawatts of power. “The need for this capacity was demonstrated during severe cold and heat events last year. In 2021, BPA issued assessments indicating the Lower Snake River Dams prevented rolling blackouts during the deep freeze and severe heat events in the Pacific Northwest. In January and February of 2021, the four dams each generated more than 400 megawatts of energy, with some providing more than 500 megawatts. Additionally, during the 5-day heatwave in June, the Lower Snake River Dams held 15% of BPA’s total required reserves. At their highest, the dams provided 1,118 megawatts of combined energy.  “The Lower Snake River Dams are not only critical to grid reliability in the Pacific Northwest, through fish passage adaptations, they achieve 96 percent passage survival for juvenile yearling Chinook salmon and steelhead smolts at each dam. “We share the goal of recovering threatened and endangered fish species in the Columbia River Basin, and we should be encouraged by recent returns on the Lower Snake River. Snake River Spring Chinook returns have increased since 2019, with 2020 returns up 55 percent and 2021 returns up 27 percent.“We understand that the [agencies] are engaged in CEQ’s effort focused on recovering Columbia Basin threatened and endangered fish species.

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/u-s-potato-export-agreement-must-be-honored-expedited-write-bipartisan-leaders,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Angus King (I-Maine) and U.S. Congressmen Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) and Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) led 30 of their Congressional colleagues in potato-producing states in a bipartisan, bicameral letter calling on the USDA to press its counter-agency in Mexico to honor and expedite the U.S.-Mexico trade deal restoring U.S. fresh potato exports to Mexico.Despite a Mexican Supreme Court ruling made in favor of U.S. potato producers and the completion of successful site visits made by Mexican authorities to U.S. potato plants in Colorado, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) acquiesced to new demands by the Mexican government that will significantly delay and limit U.S. potato exports to Mexico in 2022.“Given that Mexico appears to be continuing to avoid its responsibilities to restore this access, we request that APHIS explain its decision-making process to agree to these unscientific and inconsistent demands,” the lawmakers wrote.“We respectfully request that USDA reconsider the statements announced at the end of February, as they are not stipulated in the work plan,” the letter continued. “The U.S. continues to honor our side of this trade deal, and it is imperative USDA ensure that Mexico do the same."" The full list of letter signatories and text of the letter can be found here and below:Dear Secretary Vilsack:We write today out of deep concern for the ongoing dispute regarding U.S. fresh potato access to Mexico.  It appears that Mexico is continuing to delay restoring this access that was blocked due to legal proceedings initiated by the Mexican potato industry over seven years ago.  The cost of this inaction is estimated to be $150 million to U.S. growers on an annual basis. We request that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) continue to work with their counterparts in Mexico to ensure that the trade deal is honored by expeditiously reinstating access for U.S. fresh potatoes and to express that any Mexican request for enhanced agricultural access to the U.S. should not be granted until this access is restored.In December of 2021, Mexican officials toured U.S. potato operations in Colorado as the final step in restoring this access.  That site visit came after the Mexican Supreme Court unanimously ruled in April 2021 against the Mexican potato industry’s legal claims.  At the conclusion of the visit, Mexico indicated their satisfaction to USDA and further stated that market access should be complete by early February 2022.However, on Wednesday, February 16th, 2022, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) jointly announced with their Mexican counterparts, SENASICA, that fresh table stock potato access would be substantially delayed well into 2022. That statement was made due to Mexico’s later demands for additional site visits in 2022 as a prerequisite to opening the market. Additionally, it was announced that processing potato access to Mexico would be arbitrarily limited to only two companies for 2022.Neither of these requirements exist within the U.S.-Mexico work plan that was concluded at the end of last year.  As you will recall, the process that the U.S. is supposed to be pursuing is one to restore, not establish, access for these potatoes.  The U.S. had previously negotiated market access and was shipping potatoes to Mexico in 2014 until the Mexican industry filed suit in an effort to avoid competition with U.S. growers.Given that Mexico appears to be continuing to avoid its responsibilities to restore this access, we request that APHIS explain its decision-making process to agree to these unscientific and inconsistent demands.  Additionally, we are extremely concerned that APHIS came to this agreement with SENASICA without consulting the domestic industry and that this may be indicative of the process that USDA is undertaking to restore fresh access.We respectfully request that USDA reconsider the statements announced at the end of February, as they are not stipulated in the work plan.  The U.S. continues to honor our side of this trade deal, and it is imperative USDA ensure that Mexico do the same.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/u-s-potato-export-agreement-must-be-honored-expedited-write-bipartisan-leaders"

Cruz said during the press conference while flanked by several fellow Republican senators. ""Because the Biden administration has been eager to tell Putin and tell the Ayatollah of course we will have a carveout for the Iran deal on Russia sanctions which means Putin will make billions in oil and gas transactions, in nuclear transactions, and in weapons transactions.""Cruz added that the Biden administration is ""incoherently"" announcing sanctions on Russia while also ""creating a massive subsidy"" for Russia which ""makes no sense.""""This is not right, we should walk,"" Republican Sen.

The error would have forced counties to split funding between SRS Title I--funding for roads and schools--and Title II--projects on or to benefit federal land within the county--while no funding could go toward Title III projects such as wildfire preparedness, planning and emergency services. The technical fix applies to FY2021 only, and counties will be able to make elections for FY2022 and FY2023.The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act was enacted in 2000 to financially assist counties with public, tax-exempt forestlands.  Since then, Risch, Crapo, and Oregon’s U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley have worked to give SRS a more permanent role in assisting rural counties with large tracts of federal lands. # # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/3/risch-crapo-legislation-to-fix-secure-rural-schools-payment-allocations-heads-to-president-s-desk-for-signature"

The success of Valor K9 Academy has allowed Amy and Justin to open a second business, Valor Protection Dogs, which they operate out of Horseshoe Bend. In addition to their work with their canine clients, Valor K9 Academy plays an active role in its community. Owners Amy and Justin prioritize philanthropy, routinely donating proceeds to support local rescues and Idaho veterans in need. Their story is one of passion, determination, and service.“Thanks to its efforts, Valor K9 Academy is a beacon of entrepreneurial and philanthropic spirit for all of Idaho to behold,” Risch said. “Amy and Justin took a two-man operation and transformed it into a business that stretches from coast to coast.”“Congratulations to Valor K9 Academy and its employees on being named the Idaho Small Business of the Month for March 2022,” Risch continued. “You make our great state proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.”Background: Idaho is consistently ranked one of the best places in the country to do business.

Further, if a traveler presents one of those documents, the bill requires the TSA agent to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and local law enforcement to determine whether the individual is in violation of any terms of release. If the individual is found to be in violation, he or she will not be allowed to fly, with an exception if the individual is traveling for purposes of self-deportation.  “Under the Biden administration, illegal immigrants can present an arrest warrant as a valid form of ID to board a plane,” Risch said. “There is no question this policy tramples U.S. immigration law and threatens our national security. The Department of Homeland Security needs to reverse course now and put the safety and security of Idahoans and all Americans first.”“Arrest warrants or notices to appear before an immigration judge should not be accepted by the Transportation Security Administration as a valid form of identification to travel on U.S. commercial flights,” Crapo said. “We must have safeguards in place to further ensure the sanctity of our immigration laws and safety of law-abiding travelers and airline crew.”“The rule of law went out the window when the Biden Administration took office,” Rubio said. “It is dangerous and deranged to allow illegal immigrants to use arrest warrants to board commercial flights and travel throughout our country.”Additional cosponsors of the bill include U.S. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.

https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/bipartisan-bill-would-promote-good-samaritan-mine-cleanups,"By Jael Holzman – February 3, 2022 GREENWIRE | Bipartisan legislation introduced today would make it easier for nonprofits and other outfits to help clean up abandoned hardrock mines by wiping away past liabilities for acquiring the sites. The bill, authored by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), would clarity that so-called good Samaritans — potential property owners looking to address dangerous or polluted sites — are not financially responsible for the legacy mine waste. If enacted, the measure would set up a federal pilot program to provide up to 15 permits for good Samaritans cleaning up lower-risk projects. The Democratic-led bill enjoys support from multiple Republican senators, including Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking member John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sens. Steve Daines of Montana and Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho. “Good Samaritans who are willing take it upon themselves to remediate the damage left behind at abandoned mines should be helped, not hindered,"" Risch said in a statement. “This legislation will allow this important work to go unimpeded so responsible mining can remain a key part of Idaho’s legacy and future.” There are at least 140,000 hardrock mine sites known in the United States that were abandoned before the 1970s, according to the Government Accountability Office, which estimates that hundreds of thousands more likely exist. These sites can present many dangers to the public, from physical safety issues like tunnel collapses to numerous environmental harms such as water contamination. The 1970s saw the advent of federal rules against abandoning mine sites. However, since then, the cost of cleaning up waste and hazards left behind before those rules were in place has encumbered people and groups that want to pitch in. As of late, efforts in Congress to get tax dollars for cleaning up these sites have been mixed. Lawmakers added a landmark cleanup program for abandoned hardrock mine sites to last year's bipartisan infrastructure bill. But a more robust program to fund cleanups through royalty rates on miners was yanked from the budget reconciliation package (E&E Daily, Nov. 3, 2021). The new bill would define a good Samaritan as any individual who is not a past or current operator of an abandoned mine site, who had no role in creating the waste and who is not potentially liable under federal or state law for cleaning it up. Lawmakers have been unable to agree on good Samaritan legislation in the past. Some Democrats wonder whether the mining industry will take advantage of such programs, and say broader reforms are needed. Conservation groups backing the new bill include Trout Unlimited and the Outdoor Alliance. The National Mining Association and the American Exploration & Mining Association also support the bill, according to a press release from Heinrich's office. ""This legislation is critical to removing the obstacles that are preventing the remediation of important land and water resources, and it deserves bipartisan support to clear the way for positive, on-the-ground environmental progress,"" National Mining Association President and CEO Rich Nolan said in a statement that the group provided to E&E News. Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement provided to E&E News that the bill will “accelerate their clean up by removing barriers for conservation organizations and other partners to advance reclamation projects that safeguard clean drinking water and restore some of our most important waterways and fisheries.” To read this piece on the E&E website, click here. Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/bipartisan-bill-would-promote-good-samaritan-mine-cleanups"

This legislation would make it easier for “Good Samaritans” such as state agencies, local governments, nonprofits, and other groups, to clean up and improve water quality in and around abandoned hardrock mines.“There’s real motivation among the mining industry and conservation community to remedy the environmental challenges created by long-abandoned mines. Unfortunately, meaningful action has been heavily discouraged due to the significant liability risk,” said Risch. “Good Samaritans who are willing take it upon themselves to remediate the damage left behind at abandoned mines should be helped, not hindered. This legislation will allow this important work to go unimpeded so responsible mining can remain a key part of Idaho’s legacy and future.” “Abandoned mines across the West are leaking toxic metals that threaten our land, water, fish and wildlife—and the communities that depend on them,” said Heinrich. “I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Risch to create a path for Good Samaritan groups to clean up these sites and create good-paying jobs in New Mexico and across the country.” Additional cosponsors of the legislation include, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).“My bipartisan bill will help remove obstacles to abandoned mine clean up in Montana,” said Daines. “Cutting burdensome red tape and shielding Good Samaritan organizations from liability will increase the pace and scale of reclamation and in turn, support rural Montana communities, create jobs and restore and enhance our environment.”“There are thousands of abandoned mines in Colorado and across the West that are a constant source of pollution and threat to our watersheds,"" said Bennet. ""Our Good Samaritan legislation will encourage states, local governments, nonprofits, and corporations to clean up these old abandoned mines, helping to reduce pollution and improve water quality. This bill is a product of the hard work and collaboration of people across the West, and I look forward to working together to tackle this important issue.""The U.S. has over 140,000 abandoned hardrock mine features, of which 22,500 pose environmental hazards according to the GAO. Organizations that have no legal or financial responsibility to an abandoned mine – true Good Samaritans – want to volunteer to remediate some of these sites. Unfortunately, liability rules would leave these Good Samaritans legally responsible for all the pre-existing pollution from a mine, even though they had no involvement with the mine prior to cleaning it up.The Good Samaritan Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act creates a pilot permitting program to enable not-for-profit cleanup efforts to move forward, while ensuring Good Samaritans have the skills and resources to comply with federal oversight. This pilot program is designed for lower risk projects which will improve water and soil quality or otherwise protect human health.The legislation has received support from Trout Unlimited, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, Property and Environment Research Center, National Deer Association, National Wildlife Federation, National Mining Association, American Exploration and Mining Association, Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, Izaak Walton League of America, and the Outdoor Alliance.# # #Permalink: https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/risch-heinrich-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-remove-hurdles-for-good-samaritans-to-clean-up-abandoned-hardrock-mines"

Amid the congratulations, though, Haley and Risch warned the athletes that they will not have the same ""rights"" in China that they are ""accustomed to"" back home in the United States.""This year’s Winter Olympics is being held in a high-risk and potentially dangerous political environment,"" they wrote. ""No one traveling to China will have the privacy and freedom he or she is accustomed to in the United States or other Western countries.""""Additionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made it clear it will defer to Chinese domestic law when it comes to athletes’ fundamental human rights,"" the Republicans continued.Risch told Fox News Digital in a Monday afternoon email that Americans ""need to know there is a dark and sinister reality behind what we will be seeing on TV"" during the Winter Olympics in Beijing. ""The Chinese government, ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, seeks to undermine basic human rights, like freedoms of expression, religion, assembly, speech, and individual privacy,"" Risch said. ""Team U.S.A. deserves every bit of our praise and support, but I want them to be clear-eyed about the realities on the ground in Beijing.""China is currently engaged in a state-sponsored genocide against the nation’s Uyghur Muslim population — something critics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have knocked the Olympics and corporate sponsors over.""In November, Chinese Olympian Peng Shuai was silenced and disappeared,"" Haley and Risch wrote. ""She was silenced by the same government that is hosting the Olympic Games in which you will participate.""""This forced disappearance, the Chinese government’s ongoing genocide against Uyghurs, its other severe human rights abuses and crackdowns, and the IOC’s unwillingness to put human rights ahead of its lucrative relationship with Beijing are important issues that cannot be ignored,"" they continued.The pair warned that the Winter Olympics will put a ""spotlight on China"" amid the litany of human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Chinese government that ""has near full control over all business, media, telecommunications, courts of law and even international events.""""It has cameras that cover every inch of Beijing, and it includes government-created software that tracks every single thing you do on your phone in China, or while using Chinese websites and apps here at home,"" they wrote.""This invasive system is not for the general public’s benefit,"" Haley and Risch warned.

Redox Bio-Nutrients will be recognized for its contribution to the Burley community in the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate. Founded by Darin Moon in 1993, Redox Bio-Nutrients is a world-renowned fertilizer producer based in the heart of Burley. As a child, Darin spent his childhood on a family farm in Heyburn before beginning a career in soil science. After several years of managing a farm in California, Darin returned to Idaho in 1993 and founded Redox Bio-Nutrients, achieving his lifelong goal of using science to produce more nutritious food. Darin's focus on innovation has earned him seven patents and provided Redox's customers with high-quality fertilizer that improves their crop yields.Today, Redox supplies agricultural products in over 40 states and 32 countries and employs 33 workers, including 19 Idahoans. In addition to the company’s success, Darin serves on the Cassia County School District’s school board and helped launch Connect, a district-wide program dedicated to connecting students in need with mental health resources and free therapy. Redox Bio-Nutrients is a testament to Idaho’s industrious entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to community.“Every day, Redox Bio-Nutrients works to produce a high-quality product,” said Risch. “Their developments in soil treatment solutions have a real impact on the world, and they are a prime example of Idaho’s global reach.”“Congratulations to Redox Bio-Nutrients and its employees on being the Idaho Small Business of the Month for February 2022,” Risch continued. “You make our great state proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.”Background: Idaho is consistently ranked one of the best places in the country to do business.

To be named a U.S. Olympian is one of the world’s greatest honors, and your fellow Americans are excited to cheer you on and celebrate your incredible accomplishments. Above all, we hope this experience is a happy and memorable time for you and your families.While we want to congratulate you on making it this far, we do think it’s important to recognize a few other important factors related to the host country. This year’s Winter Olympics is being held in a high-risk and potentially dangerous political environment. No one traveling to China will have the privacy and freedom he or she is accustomed to in the United States or other Western countries. Additionally, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made it clear it will defer to Chinese domestic law when it comes to athletes’ fundamental human rights.In November, Chinese Olympian Peng Shuai was silenced and disappeared. She was silenced by the same government that is hosting the Olympic Games in which you will participate. This forced disappearance, the Chinese government’s ongoing genocide against Uyghurs, its other severe human rights abuses and crackdowns, and the IOC’s unwillingness to put human rights ahead of its lucrative relationship with Beijing are important issues that cannot be ignored.These Games will put a spotlight on China, a totalitarian state in which the government has near full control over all business, media, telecommunications, courts of law and even international events. The Chinese government, controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, has set up the world’s most advanced and intrusive surveillance system. It has cameras that cover every inch of Beijing, and it includes government-created software that tracks every single thing you do on your phone in China, or while using Chinese websites and apps here at home. This invasive system is not for the general public’s benefit. It is designed to take away individual privacy and undermine basic human rights, like freedom of expression, religion, assembly and speech to ensure total compliance with the CCP.Again, congratulations – know that America is fully behind you.
