https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/video,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) spoke yesterday on the Senate floor to encourage a resolution to the railway labor-management dispute and to highlight the negative impact a rail shutdown would have on Kansas and the world.“In my state, the harvest is well underway, and farmers need to be able to ship their crops by train around the country and to our ports where the grain will be sent to feed a hungry world,” said Sen. Moran. “The Association of American Railroads found that a nationwide rail shutdown could idle more than 7,000 trains and lose more than $2 billion a day in missed economic output. As the deadline for a resolution approaches, we are already seeing the impacts of contingency planning by railways, showing that a full shutdown would be unacceptable.”“In the event that a conclusion is not reached, I will utilize my opportunities as a member of the Senate, as a member of Congress, for congressional intervention and work to shield the impact of a rail shutdown across the nation,” Sen. Moran continued. “Our constituents deserve certainty that will come from reaching a resolution.”Click HERE to Watch Sen. Moran’s Full Remarks  # # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/sens-moran-tester-introduce-legislation-to-increase-travel-reimbursement-rates-for-veterans,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) – ranking member and chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC) – today introduced legislation that will increase reimbursement rates for veterans who must travel to receive medical care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). U.S. Representative Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) will introduce companion legislation in the House. In response to high inflation, the Veterans Medical Mileage Adjustment Act of 2022 would increase the reimbursement rate for the Beneficiary Travel Program for eligible veterans who have to travel more than seven miles for VA-related health care.“Inflation and rising costs have resulted in more and more veterans shouldering additional costs when traveling to receive health care provided by the VA,” said Sen. Moran. “Raising reimbursement rates will help keep the Beneficiary Travel Program relevant and make certain travel-related costs are not inhibiting our veterans from receiving the care they deserve.” “For Montana veterans living in rural or remote areas, getting to a VA health care appointment can mean driving dozens of miles each way to their nearest facility,” said Sen. Tester. “Increasing the mileage reimbursement rate will ensure VA benefits are keeping pace with rising transportation costs, so veterans can continue accessing their earned care—no matter where they live.”“With gas prices in California up over two dollars in the last few years, traveling is more expensive than ever,” said Congressman LaMalfa. “While some Californians try to make ends meet by cutting back on driving or other necessities, rural veterans seeking medical treatments have few options. They rely on hospitals and clinics located far from their home. We shouldn’t force our veterans to shoulder more and more of this cost because Washington has abandoned a reasonable energy policy. This legislation will increase the mileage reimbursement rate to protect our veterans from government-created inflation.”This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).Additionally, this legislation is endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and Wounded Warrior Project.The Veterans Medical Mileage Adjustment Act of 2022 would:# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/sens-moran-tester-introduce-legislation-to-affirm-federally-recognized-land-in-indian-country,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont) – members of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs – recently introduced legislation to reaffirm that any land taken into trust by the United States for Indian tribes is federally recognized from the day it was first taken into trust.Under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) passed in 1934, the Secretary of the Interior was given authority and guidelines for taking land into trust for Indian Tribes. The Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in Carcieri v. Salazar denied the secretary’s authority for tribes who received federal recognition after IRA’s enactment. The senators’ legislation would ensure any land taken into trust after the IRA is still recognized and protected and shall remain in Indian country.“Since the Carcieri decision, tribes throughout the country recognized after 1934 have faced uncertainty regarding their lands taken into trust,” said Sen. Moran. “Short of a full legislative fix, which I support, this bill will assure tribes of the status of their lands already in trust and enable stable economic development going forward.” # # #"

It was great to hear from local leaders about the power of rural broadband and what this milestone means for the community and rural health care providers. In rural communities, the distance between a patient and a provider presents a barrier to care that is difficult to overcome. Over the past three years, telehealth has filled this gap, and we must make the COVID-19 telehealth emergency flexibilities permanent. Telehealth not only improves income for hospitals, but it improves the health of patients. In order for rural Kansas to have access to quality care, we need effective, efficient and reliable broadband. With the broadband partnership between KanOkla Network and the Caldwell Hospital, Sumner County will be providing their residents reliable access to quality care. This milestone for the Caldwell community is a step forward in making certain rural America is equipped with the same resources and access as other parts of the country. Thank you to KanOkla CEO Jill Kuehny and Sumner County Hospital District 1 CEO Brooke Bollman for joining together to make this announcement possible.Visiting Caldwell High SchoolIn addition, I visited Caldwell High School, where I heard from school leadership and students about the opportunities this school provides, especially with a focus on technical vocations.

I also want to thank Caldwell Mayor Jamie York and State Representative Bill Rhiley for accompanying us on this tour.Attending Governor's Summit on Agricultural GrowthOn Wednesday, I joined state and local leaders for the Governor’s Summit on Agricultural Growth in Manhattan. I spoke with many attendees about Kansas’ agricultural efforts and the work being done to make certain that our state remains a leader in the ag industry. Farmers and ranchers put food on our tables, clothes on our backs and the roofs over our heads. Our wellbeing and health depend on a strong agricultural sector, and our Kansas producers are the backbone of this field. When agriculture is successful, Kansas is successful. Thank you to those who attended this event and joined in conversations about the issues facing our agricultural community. We must make certain our farmers and ranchers here in Kansas have the opportunity to prosper.Cowtown Days Parade in EllsworthOn Saturday, I joined area residents for the Ellsworth Cowtown Days Parade.

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/signed-into-law-sfc-heath-robinson-pact-act,"One Year Anniversary of the Fall of Kabul One year ago, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan became a moment of lasting shame. The images of Afghans left behind at the Kabul airport, fearful of the Taliban’s return to power, and the loss of 13 American servicemembers from a terrorist attack remain vivid in our thoughts.  Today, thousands of Afghans who put their lives at risk to help American and coalition troops remain in danger in Afghanistan and many who did get out are stuck in other countries waiting to start their lives anew. The rights of Afghan women have been rolled back, including denying girls a full education, and Afghans under the Taliban regime are suffering from crippling poverty and hunger. This is heartbreaking after the United States invested twenty years in Afghanistan, trillions of dollars and the lives of her sons and daughters. Those who gave their lives and all who served in Afghanistan to fight terrorism deserve our gratitude and ongoing care.  Americans deserve answers as to how the withdrawal could be so disastrous and how the Afghan government we supported could collapse so easily. Last year, I co-sponsored the Afghanistan War Commission Act to establish a nonpartisan, independent commission to examine the war in its totality, which was enacted into law. I am awaiting the work of this commission and the findings they will produce to ensure that what happened last year never happens again.SIGNED INTO LAW: SFC Heath Robinson PACT ActOn Wednesday, the Sergeant First Class (SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 was signed into law. This legislation delivers on a promise we made to our veterans that if someone serves in our military, we will take care of them and provide them with the benefits they have earned through their service. From Vietnam veterans suffering from Agent Orange to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans exposed to burn pits during their deployments, our nation’s veterans and their families will no longer have to fear being turned away from the VA for illnesses connected to toxic exposure. The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act will make good on our promise to take care of our veterans by delivering all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs.Thank you to SFC Heath Robinson’s family and all the veterans and advocates who worked tirelessly to get this long-overdue bill passed through Congress and signed into law. Today would not have been possible without their input, commitment and dedication.Joining Kansas Cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs for LunchThis week, I joined Kansas cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs for lunch. Days like these serve as a reminder that Kansas produces smart, hard-working and civic-minded individuals who want to give back to their country. As a U.S. Senator, one of the most meaningful responsibilities I have is nominating young Kansans for our service academies and helping them achieve their dreams of service to our country.It was great to have lunch with several of the cadets that I had the honor of nominating to the academy – Mason Vasta of Overland Park, Tyler Simms of Olathe, Cody Savage of Leavenworth, Zachary Bollinger of Hesston, Remington Stiles of Topeka, Aaron Eakins of Wichita, Cale Curtis of Wichita, Jack Arnold of Topeka and Taylor Ellis of Lenexa.Applauding the Signing of the CHIPS and Science Act into LawThis week, the CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law. This legislation invests resources into manufacturing semiconductors and other critical technology in the United States, authorizes investments in key technology areas and works to rebalance federal research investments to the middle of the country.A strong economy will help us produce the technology and resources we need to compete successfully in the decades to come. This legislation invests in businesses around the country to produce key technologies, such as semiconductors, here at home, creating new jobs and boosting American manufacturing. As aggression from China and Russia makes clear, it is vital to safeguard our supply chains from any disruptions. This bill is a key step in rebuilding our economy to be stronger and independent from our adversaries.Touring Rooks County Health CenterOn Tuesday, I visited my hometown of Plainville to tour Rooks County Health Center and meet with the center’s new CEO, Stephanie Bjournstad. During our meeting, we discussed the hospital’s day-to-day operations and the many services they offer to Kansans, including a walk-in clinic, testing services, physical therapy, urgent care, speech therapy, labor and delivery care and more. I also had the opportunity to meet with members of the Rooks County Health Center Board to discuss the challenges they face working in rural Kansas health care, especially during the pandemic and in its aftermath. Our rural health centers provide quality care for residents in the surrounding communities and region, even in the most challenging of times. Thank you to Stephanie Bjornstad for the warm welcome, and to Charlie Allphin, Jeff VanDyke, Jon Voss, Chuck Comeau and Dr. Mike Oller for taking the time to offer input.Speaking at Amber Wave Ribbon CuttingIn Phillipsburg this week, I spoke at the ribbon cutting and reveal for Amber Wave which is set to be North America’s largest wheat protein plant. I toured this facility earlier in the year, and it is great to see the work being done to transform this plant into a leading ingredient, feed and low-carbon fuel producer. Biofuels offer tremendous opportunity for job growth as an industry contributing $2.2 billon to our state’s economy each year. This $200 million investment will create 60 full-time jobs and drive economic growth in the surrounding area. Additionally, this facility will have the capacity to process roughly 10% of the wheat grown in Kansas when fully operational.It is great to see Summit Agricultural Group choosing to invest in Kansas, and I look forward to seeing this industry grow in the future.

My conversations with Kansans help inform the work I do in Washington, D.C. Thank you to Karl Pratt, Executive Director of Sheridan County Economic Development Corporation, for hosting this townhall, as well as those at the Sheridan County Community Foundation. I also want to thank all the local leaders who took part in this discussion.Touring Solomon Valley ManorEarlier this week, I toured the site of the new Solomon Valley Manor nursing home now being built in Stockton. The existing nursing home facility provides quality care and health services for seniors in the surrounding community, and it is great to see the construction of this new center which will improve quality of life for the residents of this home. Thank you to Solomon Valley Manor administrator Amanda Atkisson for giving me the tour, as well as City Commissioner Bob Becker for joining us and providing additional input on the ways in which this center serves Kansans in the area.Touring Lil' Hawks Village DaycareOn Wednesday, I toured Lil’ Hawks Village Daycare, a daycare facility currently under construction in Grainfield. Currently, there are no daycare facilities operating in Gove and Park, allowing this center to fill a much-needed void for childcare for the community. This daycare was made possible through collaboration with the Dane G. Hansen Foundation, USD 292, the Grainfield Community Development Committee (GCDC) and the Gove County Community Foundation. The center was appropriately named Lil’ Hawks Village Daycare after the saying, “it takes a village to raise a child.” It was great to see the work being done by the community to make this daycare facility a reality. I want to thank GCDC Chair Kay Haffner and Lil’ Hawks Village Daycare Director Ashley Schultz for hosting me and for their work investing in young Kansans. Thank you also to J.R.

The images of Afghans left behind at the Kabul airport, fearful of the Taliban’s return to power, and the loss of 13 American servicemembers from a terrorist attack remain vivid in our thoughts.“Today, thousands of Afghans who put their lives at risk to help American and coalition troops remain in danger in Afghanistan and many who did get out are stuck in other countries waiting to start their lives anew. The rights of Afghan women have been rolled back, including denying girls a full education, and Afghans under the Taliban regime are suffering from crippling poverty and hunger. This is heartbreaking after the United States invested twenty years in Afghanistan, trillions of dollars and the lives of her sons and daughters. Those who gave their lives and all who served in Afghanistan to fight terrorism deserve our gratitude and ongoing care.“Americans deserve answers as to how the withdrawal could be so disastrous and how the Afghan government we supported could collapse so easily. Last year, I co-sponsored the Afghanistan War Commission Act to establish a nonpartisan, independent commission to examine the war in its totality, which was enacted into law. I am awaiting the work of this commission and the findings they will produce to ensure that what happened last year never happens again.” # # #"

As aggression from China and Russia makes clear, it is vital to safeguard our supply chains from any disruptions. This bill is a key step in rebuilding our economy to be stronger and independent from our adversaries.”The CHIPS and Science Act will also help geographically rebalance federal research and development investments. In 2021, half of the states received under 13 percent of National Science Foundation (NSF) funds; this bill sets aside 20 percent of NSF funds for those historically under-funded states, including Kansas. Other programs, including the Regional Technology Hubs program, will help increase technology development outside of traditional high-tech bases.

The Senate passed the legislation on August 2 with a vote of 86-11.“Today, we delivered on a promise made to our veterans that if someone serves in our military, we will take care of them and provide them with the benefits they have earned through their service,” said Sen. Moran. “From Vietnam veterans suffering from Agent Orange to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans exposed to burn pits during their deployments, our nation’s veterans and their families will no longer have to fear being turned away from the VA for illnesses connected to toxic exposure. The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act will make good on our promise to take care of our veterans by delivering all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs.”“Thank you to SFC Heath Robinson’s family and all the veterans and advocates who worked tirelessly to get this long-overdue bill passed through Congress and signed into law,” continued Sen. Moran. “Today would not have been possible without their input, commitment and dedication.”The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act delivers all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the first time in the nation’s history. For more than a year, Sens. Moran and Tester led negotiations between Democrats, Republicans, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, Ranking Member Mike Bost, the Biden Administration, Veterans Service Organizations and advocates.Among its many priorities, the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will: In Honor of SFC Heath Robinson:This legislation is named in honor of SFC Heath Robinson, an Ohio Army National Guardsman who answered the call to serve our nation in the years following 9/11. He was a son, husband and father. After his service, he was diagnosed with a rare cancer caused by prolonged exposure to toxic substances. In 2020, the cancer cost him his life. Heath left behind an 8-year-old daughter, a wife and an extended family who are now committed to ensuring this country provides other veterans suffering from toxic exposures health care and benefits.What Veterans Are Saying About the SFC Heath Robinson PACT Act:Lt. Gen. Dana T. Atkins, USAF (Ret), MOAA President and CEO:“The PACT Act could not have gotten done without the leadership and support of Sen. Jerry Moran. The hard work and dedication of him and his team helped fulfill a promise that our nation has left unanswered for years. He had the backs of veterans every step of the way, MOAA thanks you for the difference you have made for millions of veterans, their families and their survivors.”Lee Tafanelli, Major General (Ret.) and former Adjutant General of Kansas:“Our veterans have fought for this country. By no means should they have to fight the bureaucracy to get the necessary medical care they deserve. This landmark legislation fulfills the basic and sacred promise that we make to our veterans when we send them off to war. The promise that we will provide the necessary VA medical care and disability benefits when they return must be honored. The legislation that you championed will have a great impact in the lives of our veterans long after their service. The knowledge that the obstacles formerly in their way have now been streamlined will provide peace of mind as our veterans move on with their lives. Access to the necessary healthcare for illnesses that have occurred as a result of their exposure to toxins during their deployment is an absolute necessity.”William Turner, Director of Kansas Commission on Veterans Affairs Office and former Deputy Commanding General of Support for Fort Riley’s First Infantry Division:“I greatly appreciate the extensive research and work that has been done by Senators Moran and Tester to effect legislation that rightfully would guarantee veterans who have been exposed to toxic environments and are suffering respiratory conditions, cancer and other associated illnesses permanent access to VA health care. Our Veterans have served in multiple locations where they have been exposed to a number of toxins that have resulted in them developing serious illnesses and they often struggle to gain access to health care and benefits that can help alleviate some of the pain and suffering they are experiencing. It is absolutely imperative that we enact the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Pact Act of 2022, as amended, to both guarantee exposed Veterans the permanent access to VA health care and also continue to establish a list of conditions that are presumed linkages to the toxic exposures thus enabling Veterans to receive their full benefits.”Pat Proctor, Colonel (Ret.) U.S. Army and Kansas State Representative:""As a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, I know so many of my fellow veterans who are suffering from the negative effects of toxic exposure during their service in-theater. And there is no telling how many of us will be impacted as we get older. I am so incredibly grateful to Senator Moran for leading this effort, standing with those of us who served, and seeing that our nation meets its obligation to those who risked their lives in its defense.""Timeline of Sen. Moran’s Work on Toxic Exposure Care for Veterans:"

I sponsored legislation that promotes economic growth, strengthens security cooperation and advances peace and democratic governance. All of this is crucial as China and Russia expand their influence in Latin America and other countries in the region are ruled by authoritarians.

I especially appreciate the interest General Milley has taken in Kansas, when I hosted him at Fort Riley and during his visits to Fort Leavenworth. During our meeting, I asked General Milley about the military’s recruiting crisis and expressed my commitment to continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to assist in finding solutions to these issues. We also discussed at length the war in Ukraine and how Vladmir Putin has destroyed the rules-based order established to maintain peace between sovereign nations. In addition, we discussed the growing competition between the U.S. and China and the risks posed to our national security by China’s continued aggression towards Taiwan. As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, I will continue to support and advocate for funding to increase the readiness of the Joint Force to protect our country at home and abroad.

Spectrum is a critical resource that allows you to talk on your cell phone, enables music to play on the radio and ensures weather satellites are able to track storms. Congress has authorized the FCC to allocate portions or “bands” of spectrum for specific uses, like cellular communications, and to auction licenses to these bands to companies for their exclusive or shared use. These spectrum auctions raise revenue for the federal government and, if Congress has specifically authorized the sale of the band, Congress may have a say in how the funds are spent. Unfortunately, the number of spectrum bands that Congress has specifically authorized and will have a say in how the funds are spent is small.This year, at the end of September, the FCC’s spectrum auction authority given to it by Congress will expire. During Tuesday’s hearing, I stated that Congress should authorize the FCC’s spectrum auction authority for 18 months to allow time for a “pipeline” of spectrum bands to be specifically authorized by Congress. This will make certain that Congress has a say in how the auction proceeds are spent and will provide certainty to industry stakeholders that are working to increase access to 5G. I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee to maintain the FCC’s spectrum auction authority and to increase the availability of advanced communications networks across the country.Speaking at the Commercial Drone Alliance ReceptionThis week, I spoke to a gathering of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) industry leaders in Washington, D.C. The gathering was a great opportunity to celebrate U.S. leadership in advanced aviation. For nearly 100 years, Kansans have promoted and embodied a culture of innovation in aerospace, which is more crucial today than ever before if the United States is to maintain our superiority in aerospace development. The innovation happening within industry and academia back home is critical for our future, and it was great to have the opportunity to highlight this fact to the more than 250 industry representatives in the audience.Announcing Federal Investment for Pittsburg State UniversityOn Monday, I joined Pittsburg State University President Dan Shipp to announce a $3 million federal investment to establish a new Center for Commercialization at the National Institute for Materials Advancement (NIMA) at Pitt State. The Kansas Polymer Research Center and NIMA are internationally-recognized research facilities in the world of polymers and plastics, leading cutting-edge projects that could revolutionize the plastics industry. The new center will provide opportunities for the innovators at the university to take their work and turn it into job-creating businesses. I appreciate Pitt State’s commitment to ensuring that the advancements made in the lab make it out into the world to benefit our local and regional economy. It was great to meet PSU President Dan Shipp for the first time, and I know he will do an excellent job in his role. Thank you to President Shipp and Shawn Naccarato for your hospitality, and to Daron Hall and Jay Byers at the city and Blake Benson with the chamber of commerce for the community’s support of Pitt State in their efforts of remaining a global leader in polymers and plastics.Visiting the Girard Medical CenterAlso on Monday, before heading back to Washington, I had the opportunity to visit the Girard Medical Center, where I toured their facility and met with the center’s medical staff and administration. It was great to meet members of the faculty and learn more about their experiences working in a small-town Kansas medical center. With the negative impacts from the pandemic, supply chain issues and workforce shortages, I appreciate the dedication of health care providers now more than ever. Thank you to the center’s CEO, Ruth Duling for the warm welcome, and to everyone at Girard Medical for your continued efforts to provide southeastern Kansas with exceptional care.Announcing New Federal Resources for Cherokee County Sheriff’s OfficeEarlier this week, I announced new federal resources for the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office. As the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice, it is my priority to support our law enforcement and provide officers and departments with the resources they need to keep our communities safe, including our more rural areas. I look forward to working with Sheriff Groves and law enforcement leaders across the state to continue bringing these crucial public safety tools to Kansas. Thank you to the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Dave Groves, and County Commissioners Lorie Johnson, Myra Carlisle Frazier and Cory Moates for joining me for this announcement.Touring Key Apparel in Fort ScottWhile in Bourbon County, I toured Key Apparel in Fort Scott, a clothing wholesaler that manufactures durable workwear from men, women and children. This local Kansas business first opened in Fort Scott in 1908 and has expanded throughout the years as it rapidly gained a reputation for producing quality work apparel. Known for their iconic bib overalls worn by farmers, ranchers and blue-collar workers, Key Apparel was announced as the official clothing supplier of the Kansas FFA earlier this year. This company also partners with the Kansas State Fair. Thank you to President and CEO Chris Barnes for providing a tour of the facility and for sharing how consistent, long-term policies are important to him and other business owners to provide stability as they navigate markets and government regulations. Special thanks as well to Rob Harrington, Bourbon County Economic Development Director, Katie Harrington, Fort Scott Mayor, and Kelly Zellner, Fort Scott City Manager for joining us.Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Kallisti Mandanis from Andover High SchoolDuring this past summer, Kallisti Mandanis has been serving as my Senate page in Washington, D.C. I appreciate her hard work throughout her time here in the Senate, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for her as she returns back to Kansas this fall. I hope her time in the Senate, learning about our federal government and serving Kansans, has been a valuable experience for her.Capitol Tour GroupsVisiting with Kansans during their trips to Washington, D.C. is a highlight for me. This past week, I met with several groups during their visits to my office for Capitol tours. It is always great to meet with these folks and to speak with Kansans about the issues that are important to them.This great group below includes visitors from many areas: Barbara Gatewood (Manhattan), Deborah Marsh (Rostraver, PA), and Karrah Timko (Elizabeth, PA); Marcia Williams (Topeka), Kim Williams-Gaston (Topeka), and Jaelyn Gaston (Topeka); Dustin and Ashleigh Mengarelli and children, Cooper and Keaton (Topeka) and Jon and Desiree Gaul and son, Adler (Springfield, VA); Ellis and Karen Hutchison and foster son, Tommy Reynolds (Belton, TX).Stendebach Family from OlatheI enjoyed meeting Randy and Steven Stendebach from Olathe this week while they were Washington for a Capitol tour with my office.Grandcolas Family from LeawoodIt was great to meet with Gary and Margaret Grandcolas and their son David from Leawood during their visit to my D.C. office for a tour this week.1st Infantry Division Soldiers from Fort RileyIt was great to visit with 1st Infantry Division soldiers from Fort Riley as they were getting ready for the Dodge City Days 5k & 1 Mile Shootout!Note: Fields marked with an * are required."

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/urging-swift-passage-of,"Veterans Need the PACT Act Passed NowThe most important business before the United States Senate is passing the SFC Heath Robinson PACT Act for our nation’s veterans. This weekend, I spoke with my Senate colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, veteran committee staff and veterans in Kansas about getting the PACT Act passed as quickly as possible. I introduced this historic bill, advocated for this bill, voted for this bill and I will work until we have this bill done and signed into law.On Thursday, I spoke on the Senate floor urging my Senate colleagues to support the PACT Act. Veterans need this bipartisan legislation passed now. This is an issue that’s taken too long to resolve – delivering health care and benefits to thousands of veterans who are ill due to their exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. For more than two years, I have worked with Sen. Tester, our colleagues in the House and Senate, multiple VSOs, veterans and their families to provide veterans with the health care and benefits they deserve.As the lead Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have worked to make certain this bill is the best version that it can be. There are not many certainties when it comes to Congress, but I assure our veterans, we will get this bill passed; and we will get it signed into law.You can watch my full speech here.Unveiling Amelia Earhart's Statue in the U.S. CapitolThis week, I joined members of the Kansas delegation and Congressional leadership in unveiling a statue of our state’s very own Amelia Earhart in the U.S. Capitol. Her statue now joins President Dwight D. Eisenhower representing Kansas as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection. With Dwight D. Eisenhower and now Amelia Earhart, Kansas officially has two of the most iconic and recognizable American heroes representing any state in the United States Capitol.Amelia Earhart is someone who is recognized for her historic renown as an aviator, but also someone who broke barriers, created opportunities for others and captivated the attention of the world with her adventurous spirit. Between two and three million people from around the world visit the U.S. Capitol every year. It is my hope that this statue of Amelia Earhart will encourage other girls and boys from small towns across the country to dream big and work hard to achieve their dreams. And for those who can’t travel to the U.S. Capitol, they can visit the Amelia Earhart Hanger Museum in Atchison where a replica statue will be on display of a determined young woman with short cut hair, a curious smile, a bomber hat in hand and a sunflower on her belt buckle.I want to thank a few people who attended the ceremony this week, and without their hard work, the Amelia Earhart statue would not have been possible: Jacque Pregont, Karen Seaberg and Rick and Reed Berger with the Atchison Amelia Earhart Foundation. Thank you for never giving up on Amelia and leading the effort to bring this statue to the United States Capitol.You can watch my full speech during the Amelia Earhart Statue Dedication Ceremony here.Fox News Interview on Sen. Schumer's Tax and Spending SpreeOn Saturday, I joined Fox News before the Dodge City Days Parade to discuss Sen. Schumer’s reckless tax and spending spree. In Dodge City, folks are worried about the rising costs of everything and are saying times are tough for us and that Congress needs to get spending under control.With inflation at a 41-year high and two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, Sen. Schumer wants to spend more money, raise taxes and attack American energy production. This makes no sense.Kansas is an energy-producing state, and I’m for an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes oil, gas, ethanol, wind, solar and electric. We need pro-growth policies, not more spending and higher taxes.You can watch my full interview here.Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Kansas Grain and Feed AssociationOn Wednesday, I met with the 2022 Tomorrow’s Agribusiness Leaders class, a leadership and professional development program for members of the Kansas Grain and Feed Association and the Kansas Agribusiness Retailers Association. During our meeting, we discussed issues facing producers and grain handlers, including difficulties in shipping products to market. They conveyed the importance of crop protection products for growing high-yield crops, as these products help make it possible for farmers to feed the world. We also discussed Farm Bill priorities, such as the working lands conservation program, which encourages good land stewardship and soil health while keeping land in production. I look forward to advancing our shared priorities in the upcoming Farm Bill and continuing to advocate for producers in Washington, D.C.Pittsburg State UniversityThis week, I was pleased to meet with Professor Amy Hite from the Irene Ransom Bradley School of Nursing at Pittsburg State University (PSU) during her visit to Washington, D.C. for the Nurse Practitioner Consortium Conference. Amy spoke with me about the Kansas Nurse Practitioner Residency Program, a partnership among PSU, Ascension Via Christi, Girard Medical Center, and the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, a topic she presented on during the conference. We also discussed the important role of medical education partnerships with local health care providers in addressing the health care workforce shortage, which is especially prevalent in Kansas’ rural communities. Without proper education and training for future medical professionals, our rural towns will struggle to strengthen our health care workforce. It is local efforts like PSU’s that will truly make the difference. Thank you to Professor Hite for taking the time to speak with me during your visit to D.C. and for your work to train our future generations of nurse practitioners.American Legion Boys Nation and American Legion Auxiliary Girls NationOn Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with young Kansans visiting D.C. who are participating in the American Legion Boys Nation and American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation, both selective, educational programs for high school juniors. Through these respective programs, high school students learn about government, public service and civic responsibility and have opportunities to exercise leadership skills and participate in the political process. These young men and women were each elected by their peers from these respective programs to represent Kansas in Washington. While in the nation’s capital, they receive valuable educational and leadership experience as they learn about the structure and function of the federal government.We also discussed the value and responsibility of public service. Visiting with our future leaders is always a highlight for me, and I know these young people will go on to do great things for our state and country in the future. Thank you to Konnor Quinn-Coleman from Leavenworth, Lukas Haas from Overland Park, Grace Malin from Lawrence and Isobel Li from Overland Park for meeting with me.Boyd Family from Mission HillsI was pleased to meet Rick and Gayle Boyd, along with their children, Georgia and Hampton, during their visit to my Washington, D.C. office for a Capitol tour led by my staff.Springer Family from LenexaI also enjoyed meeting Steven and Jessica Springer and their children, Grace, Faith and Christian, when they visited my D.C. office for a Capitol tour.Attending Dodge City DaysThis weekend, while attending Dodge City Days, I was especially honored to meet Jean Lantis, a 104-year-old resident of Dodge City who, along with her late husband Bob, has raised horses and cattle in the area for years. It was great to hear about all the ways she has invested in the local community throughout the years.Dodge City Western Days ParadeA highlight of the festivities in Dodge City this weekend was the Dodge City Western Days Parade. It is always good to see familiar faces and to visit with Kansans, and this weekend's parade was no exception. Thank you to all who came out and participated in this great event. It was also great to visit with AG Derek Schmidt, Melanie and Gary Harshberger and Dr. Scott and Mark Fischer during the parade.Hilmar Hamburger FeedWhile in Dodge City, I also attended the Hilmar Cheese Hamburger Feed where Hilmar CEO David Ahlem and members of his team provided hundreds of hamburgers for the event. Last year, Hilmar Cheese announced they will be building a new, state-of-the-art cheese factory in Dodge City. I have long been an advocate of expanding dairy and dairy processing in western Kansas, and I am pleased to see Hilmar's efforts to establish operations here and to support the community.Announcing Apache Digital Twin at Wichita State University's NIAROn Friday, I was in the Air Capital of the World to help announce the creation of the Apache Digital Twin at Wichita State University’s National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR). This important program will extend the useful lifespan of the world’s most advanced, proven attack helicopter as the U.S. Army advances our nation’s security interests. As a Defense Appropriator, I am pleased that Pentagon leadership continues to solidify the important role NIAR plays in the defense of our nation. Thank you to Wichita State President Rick Muma and Senior Vice President for Industry & Defense Programs John Tomblin for their continued leadership in this crucial field. Thank you also to Major Generals Todd Royar and Wally Rugen as well as Brigadier Generals Rob Barrie, Jr. and Francisco Lozano for participating in this important announcement.Recruiting Efforts Successful to Wichita – Operations Center and Corporate HeadquartersWhile I was in Wichita, I also joined Novacoast, a national leader in cybersecurity development, to announce its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Wichita from California. This exciting announcement comes shortly following the news of Novacoast opening its new Security Operations Center in downtown Wichita earlier this year. This move by Novacoast is further confirmation of the crucial role Wichita plays as a thriving hub for business, and solidifies opportunities for regional Kansas leaders in cybersecurity technology research and development, including Wichita State University, Friends University, Butler Community College and the 177th Information Aggressor Squadron at McConnell Air Force Base.Our state continues to be an important leader in this field, and South Central Kansas is quickly becoming a pipeline for some of our nation’s most talented cybersecurity professionals. Novacoast’s presence is creating many rewarding partnerships, along with well-paying technology industry jobs for our community. Congratulations to Greater Wichita Partnership CEO Jeff Fluhr and his team for leading this successful recruitment effort. Special thanks to Novacoast CEO Paul Anderson for his leadership and for making Wichita home for his company and employees.More Physician Education in Kansas! 91 Students Started TodayOn Friday evening, I spoke at the grand opening of the Kansas Health Science Center’s Kansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (KansasCOM). Headquartered in downtown Wichita, KansasCOM is our state’s first osteopathic medical school. Here, students will participate in a program that combines innovative, integrative and holistic teaching methods that prepare them to meet the health care needs of patients. A foundational part of this college’s mission is to address disparities in health care access between urban and rural regions of Kansas. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and member of the Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to developing policy and identifying resources to assist this college in fulfilling its mission to serve Kansans. Thank you to the local and state leaders who attended this grand opening in support of this school. Special thanks to Dr. Tiffany Masson, President of Kansas Health Science Center, Dr. Vadim Levitin, Chair of the Kansas Health Science Center Board and Dr. Michael Horowitz, President of TCS Education System, for their leadership and the work they have done to bring this health care resource to our state.Recognizing Tyler York as Distinguished Young Professional of 2022This weekend, I had the opportunity to present Tyler York with the award for Distinguished Young Professional of 2022, recognition he earned from the Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce. Tyler's dedication to our state and heart for public service have been apparent to all throughout the years he has spent working tirelessly on behalf of Kansans in my office. I was honored to be there to present him with this award and to celebrate his accomplishments, as well as the positive influence he has had on his community.Visiting Hillsboro Community Hospital LeadershipOn Friday, I visited the Hillsboro Community Hospital to check in to see the latest changes. Hillsboro Community Hospital is a 15-bed critical access hospital providing medical services including emergency services, a full-service laboratory, inpatient care, radiology, surgery, physical therapy and more. Thank you to CEO Mark Rooker for hosting me on this tour and to Hillsboro City Administrator Matt Stiles for joining us as well.Announcing New Federal Resources for Ford County Sheriff's DepartmentThis weekend, I announced an investment of new federal resources for the Ford County Sheriff's Department. Our law enforcement officers work tirelessly to protect our local communities, and they need our support in this difficult work. I joined Sheriff Bill Carr and Undersheriff Dale Coleman in announcing a new grant to purchase body and in-car cameras for their officers, a crucial investment in new technology for their office. I appreciate the work of the Ford County Sheriff's Department in keeping our residents safe and look forward to continuing to support their efforts.Meeting with Ambassador HautalaThis week, I welcomed Finland’s ambassador to the United States, Mikko Hautala, to my Washington, D.C. office to discuss Finland’s bid to join NATO and the current threats to European security. Finland borders Russia for 830 miles and takes its defense seriously—it will exceed the 2 percent GDP spending on its military, maintains high readiness, and already works well with NATO. Previously stationed in Moscow, Ambassador Hautala shared valuable insight into Russia and Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions. To protect another European country from invasion, I intend to support Finland’s accession when the Senate votes in the near future. During our meeting, Ambassador Hautala and I also discussed the need for other European countries to do more to contribute to the collective defense as America seeks to focus on the Pacific. Listening to the perspective of our European friends is important, and I thank Ambassador Hautala for making the time to visit.Attending the Kansas Society Annual BanquetOn Wednesday evening, I attended the annual Kansas State Society Dinner in Washington, D.C. This event is an opportunity for Kansans to gather together and share pride in our state. It was great to see so many friends and colleagues who attended. As part of the program, I was honored to present Senator Pat Roberts with the 2022 Kansan of the Year award. Sen. Roberts has been a friend to me throughout the years and has always exemplified true public service. I appreciate his quick wit and wise advice. It was also a pleasure to hear from the 2022 Kansas Cherry Blossom Princess, Jenny Nguyen. Thank you to the members of the Kansas delegation who attended this event and to all at the Kansas State Society for hosting.Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Hearing on Pending NominationsThis week, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee held a hearing to consider nominees to serve as General Counsel and Board of Veterans’ Appeals Chairman at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The General Counsel must make certain the VA is following the laws Congress passes. The BVA Chairman is charged with making sure that the VA gets decisions on veterans’ claims right, so veterans can access the benefits they deserve. Both roles are key positions tasked with making certain the VA is delivering for our veterans.During this hearing, I reminded the two nominees of the important relationship between Congress and the VA and how critical it is for the VA to faithfully execute the law so veterans can access the care and benefits they deserve. The work my colleagues and I do in Washington, D.C. is driven by what we hear from our constituents in our states. It is vital that these nominees, and any leaders within the VA, always keep foremost in their minds that the programs and policies we charge them with implementing are for those veteran constituents we talk to and whom we are trying to assist. I was pleased by the response of each nominee on the important, collaborative relationship that the VA and Congress must have, and I appreciated their commitments to work collaboratively with our committee as we all try to better serve veterans.Briefing by the Department of JusticeOn Thursday, I received a briefing from the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal division at the Department of Justice on the department’s decision not to pursue criminal prosecutions against the FBI agent who failed to investigate allegations of sexual assault. In 2018, I lead an 18-month-long investigation into the decades of abuse of amateur and Olympic athletes by Larry Nassar, and the systemic failure of those in positions of power, including the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University, and even the FBI, to protect young athletes after learning of credible claims of abuse. In particular, we learned of significant misconduct by at least two FBI agents in the Indianapolis field office who knew of Nassar’s abuse, failed to act and made false and misleading statements in documenting the case and describing their conduct to DOJ Inspector General (IG) investigators. After conducting an investigation into this misconduct, the DOJ Inspector General made criminal referrals to the department for possible prosecution. Ultimately, however, the DOJ declined to pursue prosecution.I am appalled by the FBI’s gross mishandling of the specific warnings its agents received about Larry Nassar’s horrific abuse years before he was finally arrested. This failure by the FBI raises the question of how many athletes would have been spared unimaginable pain if the FBI had done its job. I am disappointed the Department of Justice will not be holding these individuals accountable for their actions.Touring Hill's Pet Nutrition in TopekaEarlier this week, I toured Hill’s Pet Nutrition in Topeka and met with staff there regarding several issues impacting the pet food industry, including the federal and state regulations that must be met by pet food producers. I want to thank Carlos Gonzalez, Worldwide Director of Global Regulatory Affairs, Scott Mickelsen, Attending Veterinarian and Ingrid Stewart, Vice President and Division General Counsel, for hosting me during my tour of the facility and for sharing insight regarding the work they do. I also look forward to touring the Hill’s Pet Nutrition Tonganoxie facility as well when it opens in the near future.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."

Moran. “This issue needs to pass the United States Senate in short order. At the moment, the work before us, the work that needs to be accomplished today – now, this week – is the passage of the PACT Act so that our veterans who are encountering significant medical challenges have the care and benefits that come from being a veteran. I am of the belief that if you serve in our military, we need to live up to the promises we made to take care of our veterans.” Click HERE to Watch Sen. Moran’s Full Remarks# # #"

Moran’s Remarks at the Congressional Statue Dedication Ceremony: “When Statuary Hall was established in 1864, each state was granted two statues of citizens who were… ‘illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military service as each State may deem worthy of this national commemoration.’“Over in the Rotunda, stands one bronze statue of the Kansan, General and former President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. And for more than a century Kansas statesman John Ingalls has proudly represented Kansas as our second statue.“Today, we have a new Kansan to represent our state in the U.S. Capitol – someone who is recognized for her historic renown as an aviator, but also someone who broke barriers, created opportunities for others and captivated the attention of the world with her adventurous spirit – Kansas’ Amelia Earhart.“With Dwight D. Eisenhower and now Amelia Earhart, Kansas officially has two of the most iconic and recognizable American heroes representing any state in the United States Capitol.“I want to thank a few people in the room who, without their hard work, today would not have been possible: Jacque Pregont, Karen Seaberg and Reed Berger with the Atchison Amelia Earhart Foundation.“Thank you for never giving up on Amelia and leading the effort to bring this statue to the United States Capitol.“Amelia’s ambition and spirit of adventure that took her around the world was built on her foundational upbringing in Atchison. It is fitting that today the foundation on which she stands is limestone from the Flint Hills in Kansas.“Between two and three million people from around the world visit the U.S. Capitol every year. It is my hope that this statue of Amelia Earhart will encourage other girls and boys from small towns across the country to dream big and work hard to achieve their dreams.“And for those who can’t travel to the U.S. Capitol, they can visit the Amelia Earhart Hanger Museum in Atchison where a replica statue will be on display of a determined young woman with short cut hair, a curious smile, a bomber hat in hand and a sunflower on her belt buckle.“Amelia Earhart’s first flight across the Atlantic was as a passenger. After she landed she famously stated, ‘There’s more to life than just being a passenger.’“Greatness comes through action. Our country’s greatest achievements, and those of the world, have depended on those who were more than a passenger, who cast aside the fear of failure, and pushed to expand the boundaries of what was thought possible.“From the Wright Brothers to Amelia Earhart, from Alan Shepherd to Sally Ride, this is true in the history of flight and the history of America. It’s no less true in our everyday lives. The ordinary become extraordinary through action.“As editorialized today in the Atchison Globe: ‘Earhart was a dreamer who refused to conform to the roles assigned to women and instead blazed her own trail.” We are reminded today God created each of use to be more than just a passenger.’ # # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/updating-kansans-on-the-9-8-8,"Updating Kansans on Recently Launched 9-8-8 Mental Health Crisis Hotline  This week, while visiting mental health care centers in western Kansas, I provided an update on the 9-8-8 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that went live earlier this month. The lifeline is a nationwide network of crisis centers linked through a 24/7 toll-free number that connects callers in crisis to immediate intervention services and care with trained counselors. In 2019, I introduced the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act to establish 9-8-8 as the new hotline.   I also want to recognize the dedication of members of the Kansas legislature who worked tirelessly to implement this legislation on the state level, making certain Kansans have access to this critical service. As with the implementation of any new law, there are sure to be challenges and changes that need to be made. I will work with my colleagues to make certain this hotline is being implemented according to statute and address any changes needed to best serve the American people. Promoting Kansas as the Air Capital of the World  This past weekend, I led a delegation of Kansans, along with the Greater Wichita Partnership, to the Farnborough International Airshow. This was the largest delegation of Kansans ever to attend. The Farnborough International Airshow is one of the world’s largest aerospace events, hosting leading innovators from the aerospace, aviation and defense industries and showcasing the talent and innovation of key industry leaders and stakeholders from across the globe. As an Appropriator and a member of the Commerce Committee, I am a lead advocate for the defense, aviation and aerospace realm. The goal of our significant presence at the airshow is to bring new business, partnerships and opportunities to our state.  For nearly 100 years, Kansans have promoted and embodied a culture of innovation in aerospace, which not only improves the lives of Kansans but reverberates across the aerospace industry as a whole. Wichita is home to more than 450 world-class suppliers and is the number one manufacturing city in the nation, solidifying its roles as the cornerstone to forging the future of aerospace. Years ago, we recognized that if Wichita was going to remain the ‘Air Capital of the World,’ we needed to expand and grow our current businesses. Hearing firsthand the strengths and talent that we can offer is extremely beneficial to garnering more partnerships with our already top-tier companies. Opportunities like the Farnborough Airshow allow us to showcase our talented workforce, innovation and growth that Kansas brings to the aerospace industry.  Read more about the Airshow in the Wichita Business Journal.Calling on President Biden to Change His Energy PolicyOn Wednesday, I was on the Senate floor to call on President Biden to prioritize American energy and decrease dependence on foreign powers for oil production. This follows the President’s recent travels to Saudi Arabia to discuss the country’s oil and energy production.Kansas is an energy producing state and could play a key role in increasing domestic energy production for our country. Through this, we could increase supply and cut costs at the pump. But instead, President Biden chooses Saudi Arabia for assistance. The United States has the resources, the expertise and the domestic demand to be an energy independent nation, and Kansas has the opportunity to be a participant in that.A far more enduring and stable solution for affordable energy prices to fill our vehicles, to power our homes or to operate our farms is for the President to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy strategy.Watch my full floor speech here.Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee HearingOn Wednesday, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee held a hearing regarding ongoing issues with the Electronic Health Record Modernization program, which faces substantial delays and cost overruns. Given the actual cost estimate of this project, we must determine what is needed to make the system function safely and effectively, as well as questioning the VA on why solutions are not being implemented. The Office of the Inspector General has issued 14 reports, including two new reports last week, sounding alarms about many aspects of this program. The VA already considers the system unsafe to roll out in a large, complex medical center, and the path to making it safe is still unclear. A frank discussion about the reality of this situation, and how to fix it, is required. Our veterans and employees of the VA deserve better than what they have received to date.USITC Rules to Suspend Duties on Select Nitrogen Fertilizer ImportsThis week, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) voted to not impose antidumping and countervailing duties on urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer from Trinidad and Tobago. Eliminating these duties on fertilizer imports provides the most immediate opportunity for a near-term, partial remedy to the high cost of fertilizer U.S. farmers are facing. Over the past few months, I, along with Congressman Tracey Mann, have sent multiple letters urging the ITC, the Biden administration, and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to provide relief for farmers by not enacting new duties on nitrate fertilizer. While I applaud the ITC determination, I also continue to urge the Biden administration to eliminate duties on phosphate fertilizer products from Morocco and reverse anti-energy policies that are driving up the cost of natural gas, which in turn, affect the price of fertilizer.Questioning FDA Commissioner Califf During Ag Appropriations Subcommittee HearingOn Wednesday, the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing on food safety and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). During this hearing, I questioned FDA Commissioner Robert Califf on the status and timeline of returning FDA staff to in-person work. After two and a half years, the country has returned to normal following the COVID-19 pandemic, and Kansans expect their government to do the same. I also worry that remote work is causing issues to fall through the cracks at the FDA. In addition, I conveyed my concern about the fact that it currently takes three to five years for new food ingredients to be approved by the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine. In FY2022, I worked to secure additional funding to improve this process, and I look forward to the FDA taking steps to improve the timeliness of reviewing and approving animal feed ingredients.Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Flinchbaugh Kansas Food and Ag Policy FellowshipThis week, I had the opportunity to meet with Kansas students who are serving as interns in Washington D.C. as part of the Flinchbaugh Kansas Food and Ag Policy Fellowship Program. This program was established in honor of the late Professor Barry Flinchbaugh, an educator and agricultural policy titan who was well-known in Kansas and across the country. Through the program, Kansas students have the opportunity to gain valuable experience at the state and federal levels in food and agricultural public policy. But Professor Flinchbaugh was more than a policy expert; he was also a personal friend to me – and a mentor and friend to many young Kansans who he met during his time at Kansas State University, where he taught for nearly a half-century. His students benefitted greatly from his wisdom and empathy, and I am touched to see his legacy live on through this fellowship program. Special thank you to J.W. Wells, who is participating in this program through my office, as well as Parker Vulgamore, who is participating through Senator Roger Marshall’s office. I look forward to continuing to see the benefits of this program for our future Kansas leaders.Leadership Sorghum Class VOn Tuesday, I met with Kansans who are part of the Leadership Sorghum Class during their visit to my Washington, D.C. office to discuss the current issues they see impacting this industry. I enjoyed meeting with these Kansans from all across our state and hearing their insights on current challenges facing the sorghum industry. During this meeting, we discussed the importance of crop insurance, as well as the challenges posed for our farmers by high input costs and rising interest rates. I appreciate the insight these members shared with me during our meeting, and I look forward to continue representing the interests of our Kansas sorghum farmers and advancing our shared priorities on the federal level.Fort Hays State University Faculty & STEM TeachersOn Wednesday, I had the pleasure of visiting with faculty and STEM teachers from Fort Hays State University during their visit to my D.C. office for a Capitol tour. It was great to meet with those who are so instrumental in shaping our next generation and who are encouraging young Kansans to pursue careers in the important fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Thank you to Dr. Janet Stramel, Paul Adams, Bill Weber, Earl Legleiter, Karisma Vignery, Nicole Voss, Emma Reif, Keagan Shubert and Nathan Stark for taking the time to visit with me and for the tireless work they do to prepare young Kansans for rewarding futures in STEM.Kansas Young RepublicansEarlier this week, I met with members of the Kansas Young Republicans during their visit to Washington, D.C. Thank you to these young people for stopping by and providing an update on their organization’s mission to get young people involved in politics and to cultivate the next generation of Kansas leaders. As someone who first interned in Washington, D.C. in order to gain valuable experience in public service, I am always glad to speak with future young Kansas leaders who are seeking to benefit our state and nation through public service.Visiting Mental Health Care Centers in Western KansasKVC HospitalOn Friday, during a visit to western Kansas, I toured the site of the new KVC Hospital that is expected to open in January 2023. The hospital will provide youth in-patient psychiatric services and treatment programs for children ages 6 to 18 who are struggling with depression, anxiety or other mental health needs. Through this new hospital, young people in western Kansas will have greater access to medical and behavioral health services, benefitting an additional 600 children and teens. Thank you to President Bobby Eklofe and Clinical Director Sarah Berens for hosting me during my tour and to all the staff at the KVC Hospital, a non-profit organization, for investing in our rural Kansas communities and providing much-needed services to young Kansans.High Plains Mental HealthAlso during my time in Hays, I met with Walt Hill and Kaley Conner of High Plains Mental Health to discuss the important work they are doing in the western Kansas region to provide access to mental health services for Kansans in the surrounding communities. In July, High Plains Mental Health was among the first six community mental health centers to achieve Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) status in Kansas.The vital work they are doing is crucial in making certain that all Kansans have access to mental health care. I congratulate High Plains Mental Health on achieving CCBHC status, and I look forward to continuing to work with them in the future to increase access to mental health care for Kansans.Visiting HoisingtonThis week, I also had the chance to visit Hoisington to meet with Kansans and stop at several local businesses and organizations in town, including Cardinal Pharmacy, the Hoisington Chamber of Commerce, Ehler Chevrolet (formerly Manwiler Chevrolet), the Municipal Building, First Kansas Bank, Caleb Schultz Insurance Agency and Clara Barton Hospital. While in Hoisington, I was pleased to see Marla and Gene Mooney, owners of the Cardinal Pharmacy, along with their daughter Mallory, who is working at the pharmacy for the summer, as well as pharmacy employees Victoria Childs and Megan Thompson. It's always great to see familiar faces during my visits across Kansas.Attending the Clay County FairOn Saturday, I attended the Clay County Fair in Clay Center where I visited with Kansans about their current views on what is happening across our country and here in our state.

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/sen-moran-kansas-aviation-leaders-attend-farnborough-international-airshow,"WASHINGTON – Earlier this week, U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) led a delegation of Kansans, along with the Greater Wichita Partnership, to the Farnborough International Airshow. This was the largest delegation of Kansans to ever attend the Airshow.“For nearly 100 years, Kansans have promoted and embodied a culture of innovation in aviation and aerospace, which not only improves the lives of Kansans but reverberates across the industry,” said Sen. Moran. “After years of work, this was the largest delegation of Kansans to ever attend the Farnborough Airshow – a strong showing that will cement our role in aviation and aerospace for decades to come. Kansas is the future of flight, and opportunities like this allow us to showcase our talented workforce, innovative spirit and growth that the Air Capital of the World brings to the aviation and aerospace industry.”“It was an incredible opportunity to be in person at the International Air Show after three years,” said Jeff Fluhr, President of the Greater Wichita Partnership. “This is our opportunity to demonstrate that Kansas is the Air Capital of the World. We heard in many of our meetings that aerospace organizations were impressed with Wichita having representation from federal, state and local leadership. Senator Moran’s presence, especially in our opening reception, made such a difference as we made connections and helped to demonstrate the innovative and progressive aerospace ecosystem we have in this region.”“It is rewarding to see the influence and recognition the Air Capital has on the world stage at the Farnborough International Airshow,” said John Tomblin, Wichita State University Senior Vice President for Industry and Defense Programs and NIAR Executive Director. “The reception with Senator Moran as honorary host allowed organizations from across the state, nation and world to connect prior to the show, and both events are already leading to connections that will strengthen aerospace programs for Wichita and Kansas. I’m optimistic for a strong future as we transition out of the pandemic.”The Farnborough International Airshow is one of the world’s largest aerospace events, hosting leading innovators from the aerospace, aviation and defense industries and showcasing the talent and innovation of key industry leaders and stakeholders from across the globe.# # #"

This follows the President’s recent travels to Saudi Arabia to discuss the country’s oil and energy production.“My state of Kansas is an energy producing state,” said Sen. Moran. “We could help increase supply and cuts costs at the pump. But instead, President Biden chooses our foreign adversaries for assistance. The United States has the resources, the expertise and the domestic demand to be an energy independent nation, and Kansas has the opportunity to be a participant in that.”“A far more enduring and stable solution for affordable energy prices to fill our vehicles, to power our homes or to operate our farms is for the President to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy strategy,” continued Sen. Moran.Click HERE to Watch Sen. Moran’s Full Speech  # # #"

Earlier this year, I urged the International Trade Commission to reject the duties on fertilizers from key suppliers. This commonsense solution will help make certain farmers are able to find affordable fertilizer to grow their crops and feed the world.”In March 2022, Sen. Moran joined Representative Tracey Mann (KS-01) in urging the ITC to suspend the process to impose new duties on urea ammonium fertilizer from Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, Sen.

This program was named after Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who were advocates for providing nutritional and educational aid to children around the world. This program aims to improve food security for these children through the donation of U.S. agricultural commodities.“The McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program – or in Kansas, the Dole-McGovern Food for Education Program – is instrumental in providing one-of-a-kind nutritional resources and food to our most vulnerable,” said Sen. Moran. “In my lifetime I believe we can end hunger, malnutrition and achieve food security across the world – and it starts with programs like Dole-McGovern. I am honored to follow in the footsteps the late Senator Bob Dole in working to advance programs that provide food and education to our most vulnerable. It is encouraging to see this program’s success over the years, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this program as we continue the fight against hunger.”“The McGovern-Dole Program has done life-changing work providing billions of school meals to children in need across the world,” said Sen. Leahy. “Investing in food security and improving literacy around the world remains as critical today as it was in 2002. I was proud to be part of the effort to enact it, and I am proud to celebrate these past achievements and look forward to celebrating the work of the McGovern-Dole program for years to come.”“All children deserve access to nutritious foods. No child should go hungry,” said Sen. Brown. “For 20 years, the George McGovern-Robert Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program has made healthy meals and primary education accessible for students, especially girls, in developing countries worldwide. This bipartisan, bicameral resolution honors the program’s positive impact and Senator McGovern and Senator Dole’s leadership.”This legislation was cosponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Angus King (I-Maine), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).# # #"

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/high-plains-journal,"Interest rates, inflation top of mind in ag sectorDave Bergmeier | High Plains JournalAs the United States economy faces uncertain headwinds in the second half of the year many in the agricultural sector are talking about the impact of inflation and higher interest rates.Brian Briggeman, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Kansas State University and director of the Arthur Capper Cooperative Center in Manhattan, pegs the chances of a recession over the next year at about 35%.“I wouldn’t put it in the likely to occur category,” Briggeman said when he analyzes financial reports.Briggeman spoke about the impacts of changing interest rates in a recent webinar sponsored by K-State’s Master of Agribusiness program. He noted both subjects are tied to a cooling down of the U.S. economy. Briggeman said there are persuasive arguments on why or why not a recession could occur.Positive signs of economy include 70% of the U.S. gross domestic product comes from consumption and with the nation’s unemployment at 3.8%. Labor participation is returning with real wage growth and workers do have opportunities. Despite recent headlines about May’s decline in retail sales on a year-over-year basis, it is still above the previous COVID-19 levels.The negatives are also known. He cited a June Surveys of Consumers by the University of Michigan that indicated consumer sentiment was about 41% lower than it was at the same time the previous year, which is about as low as it was in 2008-09 during the Great Recession. The survey indicates 79% of consumers expected bad times in the year ahead for business conditions, according to the study’s author.Interest rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 2.5% as the economy began to emerge from the shutdown in late 2020 and early 2021 but has since increased to nearly 6% thanks in part to the Federal Reserve Bank’s increases in 2022—most notably a 0.75 percentage point in June—the latest hike since 1994. Cooling the housing market too much could further undermine confidence, Briggeman said.The Federal Reserve Bank’s approach to tamp down inflation has caused interest rates to be on the rise, he said. For the first time in many years the average consumer sees inflation in the headlines and it is being widely discussed for the first time since the 1970s, he said.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee in June he wants inflation to be about 2% on an annual basis. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 8.6%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in a report it filed in May.Rising interest ratesErnie Goss, the McAllister chair and professor of economics at Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, who regularly surveys Midwestern bankers, said in an email that respondents are reporting farmers have increased their borrowing due to higher input prices and as a result rising interest rates are cutting into farm income.“I do expect two more rate hikes—one at the end of the month (July) and another in September,” Goss said. “By then I expect the dangers of a recession are going to be greater than the risks of inflation. Bankers should be preparing customers for higher rates on short-term rates (operating loans) and long-term rates (mortgages and land purchases).”Goss expects the prime rate to rise another percentage point by the of the third quarter and expects the mortgage and long-term rates to rise by another 1.5 percentage points by the end of third quarter.One problem was the Fed was slow to react to inflation’s red flags, he said, and was behind the curve. In retrospect the Fed should have been raising rates in fall 2021. Two factors kept that from happening, in Goss’ opinion. Powell and others expected the rapid increase in inflation to be “transitory” and Powell was reluctant to raise rates prior to his presidential reappointment by President Joe Biden.Goss said bankers he works with are “decidedly pessimistic” about the next six to 18 months. The rising value of the dollar, which makes U.S. agricultural and energy goods less competitive to export, will slow both sectors.“Even though bankers expect 2022 farm income to rise by 12% to 13% over 2021 levels, rapidly rising input costs (interest rates, energy and fertilizer and others) will begin to cut into farm income and slow rural economic growth,” Goss said.U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-KS, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, recently questioned Powell on recent interest rate hikes and their impact on the Kansas agricultural community. In the increasingly difficult business environment Kansas farmers already face, uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of costs poses growing concern for the farming industry and its lenders, Moran said.“Part of the concern in regard to agriculture is that interest rates have a significant consequence to the profitability, to the survivability, of producers and profit margins get squeezed,” Moran said. “If interest rates continue to climb, we face declining or lower land values that create greater access to credit challenges.”Powell said confidence has been shaken because of inflation.“We need to get inflation back down to 2%,” Powell said. “We are using our tools to do that. We will get inflation back to 2% over time.”Plan your work, work your plan Briggeman said farm operations and agribusinesses need to take inflation and higher interest rates seriously and that starts with a realistic budget. For farms and agribusinesses, he stresses building a strong balance sheet.Briggeman said his advice is the operator should focus on building his balance sheet, which includes liquidity and wisely using debt as good tool to expand an operation.The operator needs to be “extremely efficient,” which means reviewing operations to look for ways to increase efficiency and control costs. However, he said, being too zealous to save money could become counter-productive if it lessens the quality of the grain or livestock.“Agriculture is an expensive business to operate,” Briggeman said. “You need to control your costs, but we have to make sure we can continue to operate.”Another takeaway is to look for opportunities to expand or improve an operation, he said. Opportunities to grow through acquisitions may make economical sense for a farm or agribusiness but should only occur in context of having a strong balance sheet.He encourages young producers to develop a strong working capital plan. Working capital is what is needed to pay for day-to-day operations. That lesson is timeless. “That’s one that makes your banker feel better if you have strong working capital with a liquidity position.”The idea of carrying no debt might sound appealing but the dynamics of farming are different. A farm and ranch operation is going to be around for many years and debt, particularly long-term debt, is a good tool to use by balancing it with a strong working capital base puts the operator in a good position long term.He provided notes from the Kansas City District’s agricultural finance book. Non-irrigated farmland values in the first quarter of 2022 were up over the previous year.“Could this rising interest rate (climate) really dampen farmland values? It might create a bit of a plateau and slow the increases. It could create demand issues.”What drives farmland value is income, he said, and commodity prices were high the first half of 2022 but expenses are higher, too.In 2021, the Kansas average net farm income was $310,000, according to information provided by the Kansas Farm Management Association. The 10-year average is $124,000.Even in 2022 with elevated fertilizer and fuel costs indications point to an average net income of $291,000.Briggeman said farmland values should hold this year but for 2023 and beyond farmers and ranchers have has some higher risks. Those include the unknown of Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine, if supply chain disruptions subside and if the U.S. does find its way into recession territory. A recession impacts consumer demand, Briggeman said. A strong U.S. dollar, like it is today, makes exports more expensive and changes competitiveness. Another unknown is production from other countries as Brazilian farmers are also in an extended drought.So far, the U.S. agricultural economy is holding up well, he said.The Fed’s exchange rate is expected to be at 3% by the end of the year. In May the Fed increased its basis by 0.75%. The Fed rate is the primary financial tool it has to help fighting inflation if those rates are up. The Fed rate can also be reduced to stimulate the economy—that might be employed to avoid a recession or help pull the economy out of a recession.The interest rates today remain below the basis rates of pre-financial crisis in 2008-09 and certainly much below policies that led the federal funds rate to exceed 18% in the early in the early 1980s, Briggeman said."

This is the largest economic development project in our state’s history.With this significant development, Kansas is being recognized around the world for our talented workforce, innovative environment and quality of life. Panasonic will bring thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs to our state which will be a massive economic boost for local businesses and our communities for decades to come. With the goal of making Kansas a destination for industry, defense, education, science, technology, engineering and innovation, we will keep our students, their knowledge and intellect in Kansas.This decision will offer opportunities to Kansans across the state from my hometown in western Kansas to Kansas City and solidify our state’s competitive standing as a sought-out place to live and work. Panasonic’s choice to manufacture lithium-ion batteries right here in the heartland of America – rather than overseas – will also improve our supply chain and make certain we are less dependent on China.Panasonic’s announcement also ensures Kansas will continue playing a crucial role in our global economy, strengthening our standing as an economic driver for the nation and beyond. Thank you to the leaders of Panasonic for recognizing our state’s value by choosing to invest here.Thank you to our Kansas state leaders who worked together at the federal, state and local levels to make Kansas not just a candidate, but the ideal partner for Panasonic.Read more on this announcement here in the Kansas Reflector.Photo by Jason Tidd, Topeka Capital-JournalNew 9-8-8 National Mental Health Crisis Hotline Has LaunchedAs of Saturday, July 16, people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis, or families worried that a loved one may need suicide intervention assistance can dial a simple three-digit number (9-8-8) to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This lifeline is a nationwide network of crisis centers linked through a 24/7 toll-free number that connects callers in crisis to immediate intervention services and care with trained counselors. It provides free and confidential support, prevention and crisis resources. This newly launched hotline designation has been the product of years of work, and I was pleased to co-author the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act in 2020 to designate 9-8-8 as the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline.Now, more than ever, Kansans and the entire country will benefit from greater access to crucial suicide prevention and mental health services. Designating 9-8-8 as a nationwide suicide help and prevention number provides an easy-to-remember and easy-to-access service for people to dial when they need a helping hand. Just like Americans reach for their phones to dial 9-1-1 in an emergency, this three-digit number can now provide immediate, professional help for those struggling with mental illness.Read my op-ed in The Manhattan Mercury here.Meeting with Greater Wichita PartnershipThis week, I visited Wichita to speak with members of the Greater Wichita Partnership. As the Air Capital of the World, Wichita is in an excellent position to lead the aviation industry into the future. Wichita is home to the highest concentration of aerospace manufacturing employees in the nation, a testament to our state’s ability to raise talented, hardworking individuals.During the meeting, we were able to witness Wichita State University’s National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) WERX program, as well as the Kansas Modification Center. These organizations are working in tandem to solidify the south-central region of Kansas as a leader in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry. This relatively new partnership has only been in place for a year, but it marks a new era in Wichita’s legacy of innovative and entrepreneurial spirit. I remain committed to making certain that our federal, state and local officials continue working together with private sector leaders in our shared mission of building on Wichita’s past successes and leading the way forward in the crucial industries of aviation, aerospace and manufacturing.Thank you to Dr. John Tomblin, Senior Vice President for Industry and Defense Programs and NIAR Executive Director at Wichita State University, for his continued leadership and for hosting me during my visit. I also want to thank Greater Wichita Partnership Executive Board Co-Chairs Aaron Bastian of Fidelity Bank and Charlie Chandler of INTRUST Bank, as well as Greater Wichita Partnership CEO Jeff Fluhr for the invitation. Special thanks as well to local business leaders Dave Murfin and Johnny Stevens who were recognized during the meeting for their ongoing investments in the Air Capital Flight Line and MRO facility.Announcing New Federal Resources for National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR)During my visit to Wichita, I was also pleased to join Wichita State University to announce a $3 million federal investment for its NIAR facility. With these new resources, NIAR will be able to expand its additive manufacturing capabilities, a technique that allows for the cost-effective and efficient production of complex products. By strengthening its additive manufactory abilities, Wichita State can continue to grow its governmental and industry partnerships across multiple sectors, particularly in the aerospace industry. As a city that is home to the highest concentration of aerospace manufacturing workers in the nation, Wichita is the epicenter of tremendous aviation and manufacturing capabilities. This announcement allows NIAR to continue building on previous successes and solidifying our region’s reputation as a leader in this critical industry. Thank you again to Dr. John Tomblin for hosting me, and for all of the staff at Wichita State and NIAR who continue to lead the way forward in our aviation and manufacturing fields.Honoring 20 Years of Dole-McGovern Food for Education and Child Nutrition ProgramThis week, I introduced a resolution expressing commitment to build on 20 successful years of the Dole-McGovern Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Since its establishment in 2002, this program has served school-age children, particularly young girls, by improving their food security, nutrition, literacy and primary education. This initiative operates through the donation of U.S. agricultural commodities.Combatting hunger is our moral responsibility, and the Dole-McGovern program plays a crucial role in this mission. I am honored to follow in the footsteps of Senator Bob Dole in making the issue of fighting hunger a priority, and in working to advance programs that provide food to our most vulnerable. It is encouraging to see this program’s success, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in the ongoing fight against hunger.Defense Appropriations Subcommittee BriefingOn Tuesday, I attended a classified briefing on the U.S. Defense Industrial Base. Our defense industrial base refers to U.S. based public-sector facilities, academic institutions, and private-sector companies as well as the production capabilities and supply chains that deliver defensive capabilities to the joint force, allies and partners. This briefing was held at my request, and it remains one of the most critical defense issues our nation faces. We must improve our defense industrial base to better respond to China – our pacing threat – and to Russia, a more regional threat in Europe. It's absolutely critical that we strike the right balance in aiding Ukraine while also making the right investments to compete with China across all domains: land, sea, air, space and cyber. A robust, efficient and effective defense industrial base is key to this competition, and I was grateful to have the opportunity to address this concern with senior Department of Defense leaders and with my colleagues.Meeting with the Kansas Soybean AssociationEarlier this week, I met with the Kansas Soybean Association in my D.C. office. During this visit, we discussed issues important to soybean growers, including biofuels policy and Farm Bill priorities. I support programs such as the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development (FMD) to help expand our agricultural exports, as it is vital for our farmers and our state that we prioritize reaching new markets and growing our existing international ones. We also talked about the challenges our farmers are currently facing, including high temperatures, high input costs and supply chain disruptions. I always appreciate input from the members of the Kansas Soybean Association, and I look forward to working with them to advance our shared priorities.Major Bobby Brown's Promotion CeremonyCongratulations to my Congressional Army Fellow Bobby Brown on his promotion to Major in the United States Army. Major Brown has spent the past six months serving our veteran and defense community in my D.C. office through the 2022 Army Congressional Fellowship program. This promotion is truly a testament to his outstanding character and dedication to our country. Throughout his time in my office, Major Brown has displayed true integrity, commitment to service and passion for supporting our military members. It was a privilege to participate in his promotion ceremony on Friday, and our nation is better off for his service. Thank you to Major Brown and wife Michelle for your dedication and sacrifice.Honoring WWII Medal of Honor Recipient Hershel W. ""Woody"" WilliamsOn Thursday, I paid my respects to Hershel W. “Woody” Williams as he lay in honor in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. Williams, who was the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, passed away at the age of 98. He was awarded the Medal of Honor – the U.S. Military’s highest decoration for valor – for his extraordinary courage shown during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Williams was a true American hero, and the sacrifices he made allowed each of us the freedom we enjoy today.Meeting with Xcel High School Students from SalinaThis week, I met with high school students from Salina schools who are part of the Excl program, an after-school achievement program for select high school students. During their visit, we discussed the ways in which my office acts as a resource for Kansans and their needs. These students also asked me questions about my time in Congress, as well as what my typical day looks like in D.C. It was a pleasure talking with this group of young leaders, and I look forward to seeing the positive impact they will have on our state in the future. Thank you to Rick Reed for leading these great high school students on their trips to Washington, D.C., and for your investment in our next generation of leaders.Kansans in the OfficeBlack and Veatch Tim Triplett of Overland Park  Brydon Ross of Overland Park  Stuart Shaw of Overland ParkChief Judge Eric Melgren Eric Melgren of WichitaCapitol Tour  Tom Browser of Prairie Village  Judy Browser of Prairie Village  James Callanan of Shawnee  Sharman Callanan of ShawneeDenton Callanan of Shawnee  Dustin Duntz of Manhattan  Kari Duntz of Manhattan  Kaylee Duntz of Manhattan   Maycee Duntz of ManhattanJohn Fulkerson of Salina  Kimberly Fulkerson of Salina  William Fulkerson of SalinaIsabel Fulkerson of Salina  Mya Fulkerson of Salina  Molly LaForge of Erie  Alison LaForge of ErieSistine McKown of Hutchinson  Christy Nusz of Shawnee  John Rice of Wichita  Linda Rice of WichitaPaul Skinner of Olathe  Julia Skinner of Olathe  Amy Skinner of OlatheRyan Skinner of Olathe  Chris Stenger of Prairie Village  Hattie Stenger of Prairie Village Alison Stoughton of Hutchinson  Damien Stoughton of Hutchinson  Murphy Weiss of Lenexa  Christopher Weiss of Lenexa  Evagelinie Weiss of Lenexa  Melissa MacDonenell -Weiss of Lenexa  Greg Wening of Prairie Village  Amber Wening of Prairie Village  Jackson Wening of Prairie VillageLayla Wening of Prairie Village  Alan Wimmer of Prairie Village  Heather Wimmer of Prairie Village  Griffen Wimmer of Prairie Village  Eve Wimmer of Prairie Village  Penny Zadeh of Overland ParkDirector of Kansas School Superintendents Association Mike Argabright of Olpe  Quentin Breese of Concordia  Jessica Dain of Kansas City  Michelle Hubbard of Shawnee   Pittsburg State University Daniel Shipp of Pittsburg  Ed McKechnie of PittsburgKansas Association of Special Education Administrators Doug Anderson of Ozawkie  Patty Carter of Topeka  Kathy Kersenbrock-Ostmeyer of Colby  Lena Kisner of Colby  Heath Peine of Wichita  Sean Phelan of Topeka  Kansas Corn  Brett Grauerholz of Republic  Greg Krissek of Hoxie  Ken McCauley of White Cloud  Brent Rogers of Hoxie  Matt Splitter of Lyons  Cate Wehkamp of Ingalls  Kansas Soybean Association Charles Atkinson of Great Bend  Teresa Brandenburg of Russell  Scott Gigstad of Everest  Dennis Hupe of Perry  Jared Nash of Parsons  Lynn Rogers, Kansas State Treasurer Lynn Rogers of OttawaJennifer Goetz of Topeka  Thomas Rafter of TopekaNote: Fields marked with an * are required."

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/tomorrow-new-9-8-8-mental-health-crisis-hotline-to-launch,"WASHINGTON -- Starting tomorrow, Saturday, July 16, people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis, or families worried that a loved one may need suicide intervention assistance, can dial a simple three-digit number (988) to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The lifeline is a nationwide network of crisis centers linked through a 24/7 toll-free number that connects callers in crisis to immediate intervention services and care with trained counselors. It provides free and confidential support, prevention and crisis resources.U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) co-authored the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (Public Law No: 116-172) in 2019 with then-Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to designate 9-8-8 as the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline.The hotline is currently accessible -- and will continue to be accessible -- using the 10-digit number: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). “Now, more than ever, Kansans and the entire country will benefit from greater access to critical suicide prevention and mental health services,” said Sen. Moran. “Designating 9-8-8 as a nationwide suicide help and prevention number provides an easy-to-remember and easy-to-access service for people to dial when they need a helping hand. Just like Americans reach for their phones to dial 9-1-1 in an emergency, this three-digit number can now provide immediate, professional help for those struggling with mental illness.”“Trimming the number from ten digits to 988 will help make it easier for people to remember and ensure those experiencing a mental health crisis or having suicidal thoughts can quickly access the help they need,” said Sen. Reed. “When someone makes a call for help, we want to ensure they are connected to a trained crisis intervention counselor who can properly assist, just like a trained dispatcher and police provide a coordinated response when someone calls 911. After a two year transition and significant state and federal investment, 988 should be ready to go live and help save lives.”“We need to do everything we can to help those in mental health crises and prevent suicide, and that means improving the tools and resources they have when they are suffering,” said Sen. Baldwin. “After working to get my bipartisan legislation signed into law and ensure funding for the implementation, I am so proud to see this quick and easy three-digit phone number launch so Americans in crisis can get the timely help and support they need. This will save lives.”Even after the 9-8-8 launch on July 16, people experiencing life-threatening emergencies should still call 9-1-1 for immediate police, fire and medical assistance. People can dial 9-8-8 for suicide prevention help, mental health assistance or substance-use crises, or any other kind of severe emotional distress. If people are unsure, they should call 9-1-1, which is for immediate police response, whereas 9-8-8 connects callers to a trained counselor who can listen, directs callers to the right support resources and prevent the need for serious medical intervention.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes: “Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, with 45,979 deaths in 2020. This is about one death every 11 minutes. The number of people who think about or attempt suicide is even higher. In 2020, an estimated 12.2 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.2 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.2 million attempted suicide.”According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year-olds in the U.S. NAMI reports that nearly 20 percent of high school students report serious thoughts of suicide and about 9 percent have made an attempt to take their lives.# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/7/sen-moran-state-leadership-announce-historic-economic-development-project-for-kansas,"TOPEKA – Today, U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) joined Kansas state leadership to announce plans by Panasonic Energy to build one of the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing facilities of its kind in the United States in Kansas. Pending approval by Panasonic Holdings Corporation Board of Directors, the company has identified a site in De Soto for the potential project. The planned project is expected to create up to 4,000 new jobs and result in an investment of up to $4 billion, which represents the largest economic development project in Kansas history. The development will be a massive economic benefit to the regional and state economy, supporting an estimated 4,000 additional jobs created by supplies and community businesses and 16,500 construction jobs as cited in an independent Wichita State University economic impact study.“With this major development, Kansas is being recognized around the world for our talented workforce, innovative environment and quality of life,” said Sen. Moran. “Panasonic will bring thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs to our state which will be a massive economic benefit for local businesses and our communities for decades to come. With the goal of making Kansas a destination for industry, defense, education, science, technology, engineering, and innovation, we will keep our students, their knowledge and intellect in Kansas.”Panasonic Energy selected Kansas due to its business-friendly climate, robust talent pool and workforce skillset, support of technology innovation, strong transportation infrastructure, and central location.This planned state-of-the-art facility will create and supply lithium-ion batteries and accelerate the future of electric vehicle innovation on a global scale. Panasonic Energy’s current U.S. battery manufacturing operation has shipped more than six billion EV battery cells. Panasonic Energy plans to expand its production of EV batteries as the automotive industry shifts to more sustainable electric technologies. The proposed development would boost the regional economy, creating opportunities for suppliers and community businesses.""With the increased electrification of the automotive market, expanding battery production in the U.S. is critical to help meet demand,"" said Kazuo Tadanobu, President, CEO of Panasonic Energy. ""Given our leading technology and depth of experience, we aim to continue driving growth of the lithium-ion battery industry and accelerating towards a net-zero emissions future.”Kansas has an established battery manufacturing sector with seven establishments employing approximately 1,300 individuals. The state was ranked second in the nation for employment and wage concentration in the sector in 2021. With the opportunity to potentially add an additional 4,000 jobs, this deal will make Kansas an industry leader at a time when the sector is predicted to grow at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent.This announcement required coordinated effort from state leadership, a key part of which was the passage of the bipartisan Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion (APEX) Act by the Kansas Legislature in the February 2022.“As the largest private investment in Kansas history and one of the largest EV battery manufacturing plants of its kind in the country, this project will be transformative for our state’s economy, providing in total 8,000 high-quality jobs that will help more Kansans create better lives for themselves and their children,” said Kansas Governor Laura Kelly. “Winning this project has shown that Kansas has what it takes to compete on a global scale -- and that our pro-business climate is driving the technological innovation needed to achieve a more prosperous and sustainable future.”“Kansas is proving itself to be an attractive place where entrepreneurs can unleash innovation and create jobs,” said Senator Ty Masterson, President of the Kansas Senate. “The Panasonic announcement shows that attraction is global.”“When the Kansas Legislature passed the APEX legislation, this was the kind of megaproject we had in mind,” said Representative Ron Ryckman, Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives.“Once Governor Kelly signed APEX into law,” Lieutenant Governor and Commerce Secretary David Toland said, “the state gained the necessary economic development tool to pursue megaprojects that could transform the Kansas economy. Panasonic recognized Kansas as not just a contender, but as the ideal partner for this revolutionary project.”“On behalf of the City Council and the community, I am thrilled to welcome Panasonic Energy to De Soto. The scale of Panasonic Energy’s investment in our community will usher in unprecedented generational economic prosperity for the state and region,” said De Soto Mayor Rick Walker. “We are honored to be part of it.”“Panasonic Energy made the right choice to select the Kansas City region due to our market’s strengths in EV and tech innovation,” said Tim Cowden, President and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “This announcement, alongside FIFA’s selection of KC as 2026 World Cup host city, our new single-terminal airport coming online and global tech companies investing in the market, reinforces the transformational success our region is having on a global scale.”“The electric vehicle industry is expected to grow eight times its size in less than 10 years, which is an incredible opportunity for states, communities and energy partners to support leading, innovative technology companies,” said David Campbell, President and CEO of Evergy. On behalf of our region’s business community, we are very excited to welcome Panasonic Energy to Kansas and the Kansas City Region, and we look forward to supporting your long-term success."" # # #"

The NCI Comprehensive Designation Status solidifies KU Cancer Center as a national and world leader in the fight to treat and cure cancer and will open new avenues for federal funding, collaborative research opportunities and deeper partnership with NCI. The millions of dollars in increased funding from NCI is absolutely critical to supporting KU’s research and development and translating their findings into effective treatments for patients. As an Appropriator in the United States Senate, I look forward to continue investing in NIH research which will provide NCI a larger allocation to distribute resources to cancer centers like KU. The grants that we frequently apply for, that are too often rejected, now stand a greater chance of being accepted.Meeting with Upward Bound Students at Emporia State UniversityWhile at Emporia State I also got a chance to speak with students participating in the Upward Bound Trio program. It was great to hear these young adults share the positive impacts that Upward Bound has had on their academic success, and I enjoyed learning more about the variation of services this program provides for them. Academic tutoring, personal counseling, mentoring, and financial guidance are just a few of the ways in which TRIO aims to improve educational experiences and sustain retention rates for our high school students. Supporting programs like Upward Bound has been a priority to me during my time in Congress because of the clear effect it has on educational access for young Kansans. I appreciated visiting with the Northern Heights and Emporia High schoolers participating in this program, and I thank the Upward Bound leadership team for their dedication to improving the lives of these promising young adults.Speaking to Emporia Lions Club MeetingWhile in Emporia, I had the opportunity to join the Emporia Lions Club to speak with them about the issues facing their community and the surrounding area. I also want congratulate the Emporia Lions Club for marking 100 years of serving their community!It takes generations of Kansans committed to serving their neighbors to achieve this goal. Civic clubs like Emporia bring us together and offer us the opportunities to make a difference in the lives of the people close to us, which is truly one of the most impactful ways we can live. I also appreciate the insight this group provided as we discussed the importance of providing opportunities for students in the local area who are interested in STEM. Thank you to Tammy Edmiston, President of the Emporia Lions Club, and all of the other Emporia Lions Club and Emporia State members who joined in this discussion.Announcing New Federal Resources for Riley County Police DepartmentThis morning on my way back to Washington, D.C., I joined Interim Director Kurt Moldrup of the Riley County Police Department (RCPD) to announce new federal resources for the department to purchase a vehicle for the Hazardous Evidence Response Team. As the lead appropriator for the Department of Justice, I worked to secure this investment for our law enforcement in order to address the growing problem of issues with hazardous materials across our state. In a time when others have called to defund the police, I have made every effort to support our law enforcement community, and to provide them with the resources necessary to fulfill their mission of protecting and serving our Kansas communities. I will continue to work alongside our Kansas law enforcement to make certain they receive the support they need.To those who serve our country in blue uniforms, thank you. You deserve our respect and gratitude for risking your lives to protect us, our families and our neighbors. I want to recognize the work of Interim Director Kurt Moldrup, Sergeant Dustin Weiszbrod and everyone else who serves with the Riley County Police Department. Thank you also to the local and state elected officials who joined us today to show support for our law enforcement, and to discuss the ways in which we can work together to provide necessary resources for our police and to keep our communities safe.Touring AdventHealth in OttawaOn Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit AdventHealth in Ottawa for a tour of their facility. During the visit, I saw firsthand the efforts of the staff at AdventHealth to provide quality health and wellness care for the surrounding community. This center offers a wide variety of services for nearby Kansans, including senior and children’s care, diabetes treatment, a full spectrum of cancer care, emergency and urgent care services, occupational medicine, neurology and neurosurgical care, orthopedic services and lab testing. Thank you to AdventHealth CEO Dallas Purkeypile, Ottawa Mayor Eric Crowley, Ottawa Area Chamber of Commerce President & CEO John Coen, Ottawa City Manager Richard Nienstedt, Kansas Hospital Association President Chad Austin and all of the health care providers at AdventHealth for hosting me during my visit. 85/15 GI BillI recently joined my colleagues on the Senate and House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs in introducing legislation to protect student veterans and their dependents, as well as schools. This bill would fix an issue that schools of higher education are facing due to new guidance issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at the end of last year. The VA’s direction, also known as the “85/15 Rule,” prohibits the VA from paying benefits to students enrolling in education programs where more than 85 percent of the students receive funding from the VA. This guidance was established to combat the predatory practices of schools targeting veterans using the GI Bill. Last fall, the VA implement additions to the 85/15 Rule may include students who are not receiving any form of assistance from the VA, artificially inflating the number of students counted as part of the 85 percent.This past November, I sent a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, asking that he clarify this new guidance and provide additional training to school officials. However, the VA did not fix this issue, causing concern that this rule would negatively impact students entering school for the Fall 2022 semester.Due to this concern, I introduced the Ensuring the Best Schools for Veterans Act of 2022, along with the rest of House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs leadership, to provide clarity for our schools and student veterans. This bill would ensure there are no negative impacts for our student veterans by requiring that the VA adjust procedures to match the original intent of the law as passed by Congress. This is an important bill, and I look forward to getting it to the President’s desk as soon as possible.Kansans in the OfficeCapitol TourAndrew Bowen of ManhattanNikki Bowen of ManhattanJacob Bowen of ManhattanLisa Browning of Overland ParkDavid Carlson of Cottonwood FallsSandra Carlson of Cottonwood FallsBryan Gansen of Overland ParkMichelle Gansen of Overland ParkHayden Gansen of Overland ParkDylan Gansen of Overland ParkSydney Gansen of Overland ParkJason Hoffmann of LeawoodDana Hoffmann of LeawoodAleksander Hoffmann of LeawoodMaxton Hoffmann of LeawoodGenevieve Hoffmann of LeawoodBill Mann of LeawoodChristin Mann of LeawoodHolden Mann of LeawoodCharlotte Mann of LeawoodClaire Mann of LeawoodConnor Olsen of LeawoodJessica West of OverbrookLaura Zabokrtsky of Tecumseh4-H Citizen Washington Focus Group John Jobe of Riley CountyNote: Fields marked with an * are required."

But my main priority is to make Kansas a place where we are not only recruiting the top talent in the world to our state, but also keeping our students, their knowledge and intellect in Kansas. That Kansans have the opportunity to change the world right here at home.“KU Cancer Center now joins only 52 institutions across the country that have earned the NCI Comprehensive Designation. There are a number of individuals who deserve a special thanks today, and especially the entire leadership team at the KU Cancer Center. Chancellor Doug Girod, Dr. Robert Simari and Dr. Roy Jensen should feel immense pride in their team and the work at KU Cancer Center. This is only the beginning, and really good things continue and begin to happen here at the KU Cancer Center. God willing, one day we will provide something more than hope. We will provide that cure.”Statements from Leaders at The University of Kansas:“Nearly 20 years ago, this entire community joined together and decided that national designation, and ultimately Comprehensive designation, of our cancer center was our top priority as a region. It was our moonshot,” said Douglas A. Girod, M.D., chancellor of the University of Kansas. “Well, today we’ve landed on the moon, so to speak. What was once a dream is now a reality. And that reality means better patient care, better health outcomes and better research. And it means we are one step closer to our ultimate goal – which is to rid our society of cancer so that we all have the opportunity to live happier, healthier lives.”“Comprehensive designation is a crucial milestone in our journey to conquer all cancers,” said Roy Jensen, M.D., director of the KU Cancer Center. “You might ask, ‘What does Comprehensive designation mean for people with cancer?’ As one of just 53 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation, it means patients will be cared for by the world’s leading cancer experts who have access to a robust portfolio of clinical trials. It also means we now have increased access to more federal funding and research dollars, which helps us grow and retain our team of internationally renowned researchers and physician-scientists.”“Two decades ago, when KU Medical Center leadership decided to focus on cancer research, there were some who worried that other areas might be left behind,” said Robert D. Simari, M.D., executive vice chancellor of the University of Kansas Medical Center. “However, it has never been more true that rising tides raise all ships. With the success of the cancer center, centers of excellence in Alzheimer’s disease, kidney disease, diabetes, aging and many others have flourished.”Timeline of KU Cancer Center’s Comprehensive Designation Status Application:Additional Federal Resources: # # #"

SCCC is also helping train and equip individuals who have immigrated to the U.S. by implementing language education alongside their technical programs.I appreciate President Brad Bennett, Dr. Amber Jones and Trustees Kay Burtzloff and John Engel for inviting me to spend part of my morning at SCCC. Furthermore, I appreciate the hard work of SCCC to make certain that their educational programs are translated into real-world job opportunities.Touring Kansas HospitalsMorton County Health SystemEarlier this week, I visited the Morton County Health System in Elkhart for a tour of their facilities and to learn more about their valuable role providing care to the surrounding community. As a result of legislation passed by Congress in December 2020, the facility is working towards a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) hospital designation that is designed to provide rural hospitals with a higher reimbursement rate. It was great to see the dedicated work of the hospital firsthand, and I remain committed to investing in rural Kansas hospitals by supporting their efforts to ensure access to quality care for the surrounding community.As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I was able to secure a federal investment for the Morton County Health System to renovate and consolidate outdated wings of the building so they can continue providing care for rural Kansans.

And a special thank you to Lori Pendergast who is retiring after 40 years in the industry including over 20 years at Arrowhead West.Visiting with Veterans at the Kansas Soldiers’ Home in Fort DodgeIt was great to visit with veterans at the Kansas Soldiers’ Home in Fort Dodge. There is no group of Americans who I respect and admire more than our country’s veterans, and it is always a privilege to spend time visiting with them about their views on current happenings in our state and country. This facility in Fort Dodge, located on the grounds of a former military post which was active from 1865 to 1882, has been serving veterans for over 130 years. Today, the Fort Dodge Kansas Soldiers’ Home offers a wide range of quality health care services for veterans, including restorative care, physical and occupational therapy and psychological services. As the lead Republican on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and a member of the Appropriations Committee, I worked to secure federal resources to improve and renovate the kitchen at the Kansas Soldiers’ Home.

Through the “Accelerating Economic Prosperity in the Heartland” project, I was honored to secure a federal investment in this crucial effort. This grant will provide valuable improvements to this rail system that runs through several rural communities in Kansas. Throughout the years, the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad has played a key role in ensuring our commodities make it to market, strengthening Kansas’s role as a significant food source for our country and beyond. Without efficient and varied transportation options, our agricultural community here in Kansas is at a disadvantage. Modernizations to the South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad will improve safety and efficiency while allowing heavier shipments to travel across the region providing new economic opportunities to our farmers and manufacturers in rural Kansas. I want to thank Watco CEO Dan Smith and SKOL Manager Jerry Waun for their work in this effort, as well as members of Bartlett Grain for attending this ceremony. I look forward to seeing the benefits of this project come to fruition.Meeting with Seaboard CorporationThis week, I was able to meet with executives of the Seaboard Corporation at their headquarters in Shawnee Mission.

During my visit, I was able to get an in-depth look at the state-of-the-art logistics facility that Kubota has built here in Kansas. I appreciate Kubota’s decision to plant roots in our state, as this business is one that actively supports the agricultural interests of our Kansas communities. The Kubota branch in Edgerton not only benefits our farming community, but also plays a key role in strengthening our state’s manufacturing abilities and creating new jobs for Kansans. I appreciate Corey Sowers, Kathi Dailey, Donald Orum, Ashlin O’Brien, Justin McGarry and Jerry Burau for their warm welcome and informative tour.Visiting Baldwin CityI also had the chance to stop in Baldwin City to visit local businesses and organizations and to spend time speaking with several city leaders about the issues facing their local community.

During my time in Baldwin City, I was able to visit City Hall, the Baldwin City Chamber of Commerce, Clear Wave Fiber, Baldwin State Bank, Farm Bureau Financial, Edward Jones and Baker University. I want to express special thanks to Dr. Lynne Murray, President of Baker University, for taking the time to meet with me and for updating me on the important work they are doing to train tomorrow’s workforce.Meeting with the International Association of Machinists and AerospaceI had the opportunity to meet with Kansans from Wichita representing the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace during their recent visit to my Washington D.C. office. These individuals embody the heart of the aerospace industry, and it was great to hear their perspectives and concerns about the issues facing this crucial industry. I look forward to future discussions with this group, and to continuing to work alongside them as we find ways in which my office can be helpful in supporting this important field on the federal level.Kansans in the OfficeAcademy of Medical Surgical NotesMonica van der Zee of LenexaD.C.

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/supreme-court-ruling-on-roe-v-wade,"Supreme Court Ruling on Roe v. WadeSince Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, numerous, sensible laws designed to protect the lives of the unborn have been blocked by unelected judges. On Friday, nearly 50 years after Roe, the Supreme Court ruled there is no constitutional right to an abortion. As Justice Alito stated, “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” With this ruling, the American people will again have the opportunity to make their voices heard through their representatives and the legislative process. This decision will now allow legislatures, accountable to the citizens who elected them, to take action to pass laws that protect children in the womb and support their mothers.Announcing Amelia Earhart Statue to be Placed in U.S. CapitolToday, I joined Senator Roger Marshall in announcing that the Architect of the Capitol approved placement of a statue of Amelia Earhart – the most famous woman in aviation and in Kansas history – in the U.S. Capitol. The Congressional Statue Dedication Ceremony will take place on July 27. A bold and inspiring aviator, Amelia Earhart soared into the history books, setting flight records and breaking barriers. She led the way for thousands of women to pursue their dreams – whether that was in aviation or to break their own, new barriers.Next month, the statue of Amelia Earhart will join President Dwight D. Eisenhower as bronze beacons representing Kansas in our nation’s capital. I want to thank the Atchison Amelia Earhart Foundation, the Earhart family and the City of Atchison for their tireless work to bring Amelia to the Capitol.The National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol consists of 100 statues – two contributed by each state. Kansas first sent marble statues of U.S. Senator John James Ingalls and Kansas Governor George Washington Glick to the U.S. Capitol. In 1999, the Kansas Legislature voted to replace these two statues with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Amelia Earhart. The Amelia Earhart statue will be the 10th woman represented in the 100 statues in the U.S. Capitol. The bronze statue of Earhart was created by George and Mark Lundeen and will be a twin to an Amelia Earhart statue that will be placed at the Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum in Atchison.Questioning Federal Reserve Chairman Powell on Rate Hikes on Agricultural IndustryOn Wednesday, I questioned Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell during a U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on recent interest rate hikes and their impact on the Kansas agricultural community. In the increasingly difficult business environment Kansas farmers already face, uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of costs poses growing concern for the farming industry and its lenders.Farming is a noble calling, and our agricultural industry is the backbone of our nation and the world. Kansas farmers already face an uphill climb as costs rise and profit margins shrink. Our agricultural community must be given the confidence that the Fed will do all in its power to prevent rate hikes from threatening this essential industry.You can watch the video here.Senate Gun Safety LegislationLast week, I voted to oppose the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act on the Senate floor. We can and must do a better job of preventing violence, however we must work to address the root issues of violent crime rather than create new laws that hinder the Second Amendment rights of legal gun owners. In order to make our policies genuinely effective, we should start by enforcing existing gun laws, punishing criminals to the fullest extent of the law and ensuring our schools are safe from senseless acts of violence. We must also recognize that violence cannot be solved by the federal government alone. State legislatures should work to find solutions that fit the needs of their states, and we ought to always be working to instill family values, rid our communities of hate, support our law enforcement and end the stigma of mental health.Touring the University of Kansas Cancer CenterOn Tuesday morning, before returning to Washington, D.C., I had the opportunity to visit The University of Kansas Cancer Center – the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in the region. It was great to tour the state-of-the-art facility and meet with some of the hardworking individuals who lead cancer research in the heartland. I am grateful for their work and dedication to finding new treatments and a cure for cancer. Thank you to Dr. Roy Jensen, Dr. Robert Simari and Christine Thomas for taking the time to provide a tour of the research labs.Responding to Biden’s Gas Tax Holiday ProposalOn Wednesday, President Biden called on Congress to suspend the federal gas and diesel fuel tax for three months. However, a federal gas tax holiday is a trivial attempt to address a serious issue that is hurting Kansas families. When President Biden took office he immediately sought to undermine American fossil fuel production – creating significant difficulty and uncertainty for domestic producers which has contributed to gas prices skyrocketing to historic levels. The Biden administration must shift course and pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy which unleashes American oil and gas production.Questioning U.S. Trade Ambassador Katherine TaiOn Tuesday, during my Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, I questioned U.S. Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai regarding the soaring costs of imported fertilizer. The increasing input prices facing farmers are tightening margins and straining their ability to operate. The U.S. Trade Representative must work to reduce trade barriers and ensure farmers have access to an adequate supply of fertilizers. The Biden administration must reverse anti-energy policies that are driving up the cost of fertilizer inputs like natural gas, and roll back tariffs on phosphates and nitrogen fertilizers. I also asked Ambassador Tai about ongoing negotiations to lower duties on softwood lumber and steel. Homebuilders in Kansas are seeing growing costs of materials, which is driving up home prices, and forcing low- and middle-income buyers out of the market. When our country faces an affordable housing shortage, and the world is facing decreased food production, we should not let high tariffs stand in the way of Kansans meeting these needs.Holding Big Tech AccountableLast week, I joined Senator Roger Marshall as a co-sponsor of the Political Bias of the Algorithm Sorting (BIAS) Emails Act. This important legislation would provide needed accountability to Big Tech. Censorship of political emails by Big Tech hurts Kansans’ ability to decide for themselves who they want to elect as their representatives. We must make certain Big Tech does not use biased algorithms that are designed to influence voters and push agendas.Indian Affairs Committee HearingOn Wednesday, the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on the Department of Interior’s recently published report on Federal Indian Boarding Schools. I listened to Secretary Deb Haaland provide moving testimony on the impact of these schools on Native American children and successive generations. The report listed a dozen schools in Kansas, and described conditions at the Haskell Institute and Kickapoo Boarding School. We must know our past to build our future, and this report is a necessary starting point for the work ahead. Before the hearing began, I visited with Secretary Haaland and Assistant Secretary Bryan Newland about the need to quickly hire a new president at Haskell to provide stability, and I was pleased they both informed me this is a priority for the department.Addressing the Kiwanis Club in NewtonLast week, I was pleased to join the Kiwanis Club in Newton and speak with them about the current issues impacting their community. I always appreciate hearing input from Kansans on what is important to them, as well as their insight regarding current happenings in our state and nation. Thank you to Kelly McElroy, the Newton City Manager, for the invitation and to the entire Kiwanis Club for hosting me.Touring Agco Corporation in HesstonLast week, I stopped by Agco Corporation in Hesston to tour their facilities and to visit with their senior leadership on the current issues facing their business and community. A highlight of my tour was the opportunity to see the final production of the combines and swathers they manufacture. Thank you to Beth Shelton, Executive Director of the Harvey County Economic Development, Megan Smith, Executive Director of the Hesston City Chamber, Susan Swartzendruber, Hesston City Councilmember, and all of the senior leadership of Agco Corporation for hosting me during this tour.Visiting Full Vision in NewtonOn Monday, I was in Harvey County and had the opportunity to tour Full Vision, a precision metal fabrication ship that has been in business for 60 years. Thank you to Doug Scheible and his team for showing me the wide array of products they manufacture, including equipment roll over bars and medical grade treadmills. Thank you to Newton City Manager Kelly McIlroy and Economic Development Director Zach McHatton, as well as Harvey County Economic Development Director Beth Shelton, for joining the tour.Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Sedgwick County Commissioner Sarah LopezOn Thursday, I met with Sedgwick County Commissioner Sarah Lopez to discuss the federal government’s economic development initiatives and how these initiatives will assist Sedgwick County. As the Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, I help fund the Economic Development Administration and their work to build durable economies across the country, including in Kansas. I look forward to continuing to work alongside local leaders, like Commissioner Lopez, to strengthen the local economies in our state.Kansas Music Educators AssociationI enjoyed meeting with members of the Kansas Music Educators Association in our nation’s capital last week to discuss their legislative priorities, as well their efforts to grow the number of music educators in Kansas and provide more opportunities in music for Kansas students. Thank you to Jamie Minneman, John Taylor, Kelly Knedler and Holly Taylor for sharing their insights on the challenges for music educators and their accomplishments in training young Kansans to have a love for music. I look forward to continuing to work together with these educators to make certain all Kansas students have access to a well-rounded education.Douglas County 4-H GroupOn Wednesday, I welcomed members of the Douglas County 4-H to my D.C. office. It’s always great to spend time with young Kansans, and this group was no exception. I enjoyed speaking with these young men and women about the positive effects that 4-H has had on their lives. I have no doubt that they are all on the path to becoming great leaders who will positively impact our state in the years to come.Wheat Harvest Near AlbertI wanted to share this photo of the Kansas wheat harvest that I received this week from Katie Rosborough and her dad. Kansans truly do feed the world, and pictures like this one are a great reminder of the dedication our Kansas farmers have in this mission.Kansans in the Office ALS Association Kim Harber of Overland ParkCheri Mathis of Overland ParkBill Stinson of Arkansas CityShelley Stinson of Arkansas CityAmerican Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Daisy Butler of NewtonSophie Hamilton of LawrenceDanielle Ferguson Ticao of OlatheAmerican Physical Therapy AssociationCarolyn Bloom of TopekaMarsha Lawrence of StilwellCargill Kooper O’Brien of Overland ParkCystic Fibrosis FoundationMeladie Blair of WichitaKisha Blair of WichitaAnnie Freeman of Mission HillsMary Freeman of Mission HillsD.C.

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/sens-moran-marshall-announce-amelia-earhart-statue-to-be-placed-in-u-s-capitol-on-july-27,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (Kan.) and Roger Marshall (Kan.), M.D. today announced that the Architect of the Capitol approved the placement of Amelia Earhart’s statue in the U.S. Capitol. The Congressional Statue Dedication Ceremony will take place on July 27, 2022.“The statue of Amelia Earhart – the most famous woman in aviation and in Kansas history – will officially be placed in the United States Capitol,” said Sen. Moran. “A bold and inspiring aviator, Amelia Earhart soared into the history books, setting flight records and breaking barriers. She led the way for thousands of women to pursue their dreams – whether that was in aviation or to break their own, new barriers. Next month, the statue of Amelia Earhart will join President Dwight D. Eisenhower as bronze beacons representing Kansas in our nation’s capital. I want to thank the Atchison Amelia Earhart Foundation, the Earhart family and the City of Atchison for their persistent work to bring Amelia to the Capitol.”“Amelia Earhart was a true Kansas pioneer who exemplifies our state motto: Ad Astra Per Aspera – To The Stars with Difficulty. It is fitting that Earhart replaces John James Ingalls statue in our Nation’s capital – who in 1861 as Secretary of the state senate added this motto to the Kansas state seal.  Ingalls’ vision for Kansas comes to fruition in Amelia Earhart’s courageous spirit,” said Sen. Marshall. “Today, Kansas is known as the Air Capitol of the World and the placement of the Earhart Statue in our nation’s capital furthers our commitment to that industry. As the birthplace of Earhart, we commend the city of Atchison and its leaders who worked diligently to make this statue possible. We all look forward to the opening of the Amelia Earhart Hanger Museum in 2023 which will hold an identical statue at home in our state.”“Guided by Amelia’s legacy of perseverance, we are excited to finally bring Earhart’s statue to National Statuary Hall to honor her enduring impact as a world-renown American aviator and advocate for women’s equal rights,” said Jacque Pregont, chair of the Amelia Earhart Statuary Hall Selection Committee and board member of the Atchison Amelia Earhart Foundation. “Amelia’s statue will stand as an inspiring symbol — particularly for women and girls —  to boldly pursue their dreams” Items of note: # # #"

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/spacenews,"Sierra Space to partner with Spirit AeroSystems on Dream Chaser cargo modulesJeff Foust | SpaceNewsWASHINGTON — Sierra Space announced May 31 a strategic partnership with aerospace manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems for production of cargo modules for its Dream Chaser vehicles.The companies said they signed a letter of intent under which Spirit will assist in the development and production of Shooting Star, the cargo module attached to the aft end of the Dream Chaser lifting body vehicle. That module will support future cargo missions to the International Space Station under Sierra Space’s contract with NASA, and for other applications.Shooting Star can carry about 4,500 kilograms of pressurized and unpressurized cargo, and also has solar panels and thrusters. While the Dream Chaser itself returns to Earth to fly additional missions, the Shooting Star module is jettisoned before reentry and burns up in the atmosphere, meaning a new module is needed for each mission.Sierra Space built the first Shooting Star module on its own, but suggested in the statement that partnering with Spirit, a company best known for producing aircraft structures, can lower costs for future modules. “Shooting Star is another innovative technological solution from Sierra Space for the new space economy, and with Spirit as a key partner, we are broadening accessibility to our offering and increasing efficiencies to accelerate more widespread adoption,” Tom Vice, chief executive of Sierra Space, said in a statement.“Spirit AeroSystems brings unparalleled value in terms of design for manufacturability and industrialization to help scale production rates on the Dream Chaser and its derivatives,” said Tom Gentile, president and chief executive of Spirit AeroSystems, in the statement.Gentile thanked Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who serves on both the Senate Commerce Committee and the appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, for bringing the two companies together. Spirit is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas.Besides producing Shooting Star cargo modules for future ISS cargo missions, the companies said in the statement that, through the partnership, they will “expand the versatility of variant designs in support of future Sierra Space cargo and service missions.”The first Dream Chaser mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than the first quarter of 2023 on the second flight of United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket. It is the first of at least seven missions under a Commercial Resupply Services 2 contract awarded in 2016."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/wichita-business-journal,"Spirit AeroSystems partners to build space vehiclesDaniel McCoy | Wichita Business JournalSpirit AeroSystems Inc. has entered an agreement that will have it help design and build space vehicles for an ambitious Colorado-based space company.Spirit (NYSE: SPR) said the deal will pair it with Sierra Space to help build its planned Shooting Star cargo module and further develop that company’s planned family of Dream Chaser spaceplanes.“We are very excited about the opportunity this partnership with Sierra Space represents,” Spirit CEO Tom Gentile says in a news release. “Spirit AeroSystems brings unparalleled value in terms of design for manufacturability and industrialization to help scale production rates on the Dream Chaser and its derivatives. We look forward to joining Sierra Space on its mission to create exciting breakthroughs that enable existing businesses, entrepreneurs, researchers and governments to empower humanity to enhance life on Earth. We are grateful to Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who assisted with connecting our two companies to make this partnership possible.”The Shooting Star will be a 15-foot transport vehicle with a 10,000-pound payload that will attach to the Dream Chaser spaceplane.Sierra Space spun off last year to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of its parent company, Sierra Nevada Corp., a privately held Sparks, Nev.-based defense and aerospace contractor. The business’ owners, Fatih and Eren Ozmen, are married billionaires who hired CEO Tom Vice last summer from supersonic jet plane startup Aerion after that business lost funding.Spirit had been in line for work with Aerion prior to that business folding.“Through this long-term partnership, Sierra Space is delighted to begin work with Tom’s (Gentile) team at Spirit AeroSystems, widely recognized as leaders in the aerospace industry and aligned with our vision of an accessible and vibrant space economy,” Vice says. “Working with Spirit Defense and Space, we will broaden access to tomorrow’s space economy; lowering the cost of entry and increasing the speed to market of Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser franchise. Together we will accelerate the commercialization of space.”The Denver Business Journal has much more on Vice and his ambitions for Sierra Space in this report from February.Sierra Space secured $1.4 billion in capital in 2021 to mark the largest Series A capital raise of last year and the second-largest private capital raise in history.Space work has been a growing priority for Spirit, so much so that it rolled those programs into those for its military customers last year to form Spirit Defense & Space.The company expects that to be a $1 billion business unit by the middle of the decade."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/kansas-reflector,"Closing of Topeka deli Porubsky’s marks end of an era — and earns tribute from Sen. Jerry MoranEditorial: Clay Wirestone | Kansas ReflectorWe live in an age of cookie-cutter culture.Drive around most places in Kansas — and the United States — and you’ll find the same Walmarts, the same Taco Bells, the same Applebees. You’ll see people dressed in the same clothes, driving the same cars, speaking in the same neutral accent.What you won’t find anymore in Topeka is Porubsky’s.C.W. Porubsky’s Deli and Tavern was special, a one-of-a-kind restaurant — a kind that cities used to treasure before they sold their souls to developers and chain stores. If you had one of their sinus-clearing pickles or a bowl of their incomparable chili, you experienced something special.You experienced something unique, rooted in our state’s capital.After three-quarters of a century, the owners closed up shop at the end of last month. The usual local news outlets ran stories, but a special tribute came last week in the U.S. Senate.Sen. Jerry Moran gave a speech, but not about some political disagreement with the Biden administration or a pressing need for investment in Kansas. No, the state’s senior senator gave a heartfelt tribute to Porubsky’s.“To someone from out of town, Porubsky’s Grocery and Meat doesn’t seem like much,” he said. “But for railroad workers, Topeka locals and legislators from the Statehouse who frequent Porubsky’s, it was the best place in town to grab a delicious meal and receive a friendly welcome.”Moran talked about the restaurant’s history, as well as his own.“My personal experience with the Porubsky’s dates back to my time in the Kansas Legislature,” he said. “Several of my fellow legislators and I would make the trek to Porubsky’s during legislative breaks. Meeting from January through June meant that we had at least three full months to truly enjoy Porubsky’s hot pickles and spicy chili. With meat and cheese trays displayed, the restaurant was a warm respite from the cold and a welcome break from our political and governmental dealings.”More recently, Moran told the Senate, he still made a point of heading to the spot for “a ham salad sandwich with three slices of cheese and a cold Coke.” The restaurant was a respite from Washington, D.C., insider conversation and a reminder of a world where not everything revolves around politics.“While Porubsky’s and many other family-owned establishments like it lack the bells and whistles of nationwide chains, the underlying quality, which truly matters, is the collection of people it takes to make it work,” Moran said.At Kansas Reflector, we last covered Porubsky’s nearly three months ago, on March 5. Freelance writer Linda Ditch dropped by to take the temperature of locals on the Russia-Ukraine war.What she found was general concern and customers otherwise hesitant to say too much.“The folks in Porubsky’s seemed reluctant to talk about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Ditch wrote. “Everyone is sensitive to how politically divided the United States is right now. In true Midwestern fashion, no one wants to insult or upset the customers who have kept the shop going strong during the pandemic.”That’s another lost value. As our country has become more homogenized, with the same stores and style everywhere you look, politics has become a kind of national team competition. The red and blue divide pervades, with Democrats becoming more like Democrats everywhere and Republicans becoming more like Republicans everywhere. In a city like Topeka it can be difficult to avoid ideological bitterness in regular conversation.“Squeezing into a seat at the restaurant it doesn’t matter if you are Republican or a Democrat; it doesn’t matter where you come from; at places like Porubsky’s everyone is welcome,” Moran said toward the end of his remarks.I understand that the closing of a restaurant after a long and healthy life might not seem like much when our country convulses with violence and division. But as our senator noted, Porubsky’s was a place that united Topeka visitors and residents alike.We’re all the poorer to see it go."

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/salina-post,"Moran, K-State's Linton take in harvest at Knopf Family farm near GypsumLeslie Eikelberry | Salina PostGYPSUM - The Knopf family had some high-powered harvest help Saturday as U.S. Senator Jerry Moran and new Kansas State University President Richard Linton visited the farm just northwest of Gypsum.Justin Knopf said his family had just started harvesting wheat on Friday. Although he has yet to be able to determine yield, he did say that the moisture content of the wheat was approximately 10 percent, which was under the limit of 13 percent moisture. Knopf said that he expected yields to be below average, in part because of dry conditions earlier in the growing season.Farmers are scramblingWith soaring temperatures and drying winds, wheat harvest has moved quickly into the heartland of Kansas, causing some farmers to scramble and others, like the Knopfs, to juggle multiple farming tasks under time and weather restraints, such as spring seeding, putting up hay, taking care of weeds, and, of course, wheat harvest.""Everything's kind of stacked up,"" Knopf said. ""All of us farmers are scrambling, trying to get our spring crops, milo mostly now, milo and a few soy beans finished up before the moisture leaves. We been at 100 degrees to upper 90s every day, so evaporation rates are really high, so we're putting a priority on getting that crop in.""Knopf said that while he wasn't trying to make a political statement, he did believe the weather has become more extreme. He noted that the area had gone from drought conditions to having 10-to-11 inches of rain to then being hit with 100-degree weather within a matter of a few months.""It is incredibly challenging to grow things with that type of extremes,"" Knopf said.The evolution of harvest storage in KansasKnopf noted that when he was growing up, farmers utilized the small-town grain elevators.""When I was young, we would haul all of our grain to Kipp or to Gypsum. There were rail spurs going out to all those little grain elevators. So that's what it was like 30 years ago,"" Knopf said.Now, the rail spurs have been taken out and the farms have grown in size, prompting farmers to haul their grain to larger terminal elevators.""So all our grain goes into Salina to Scoular, Cargill, and ADM,"" he said.Knopf said he knew of farmers 100 miles away who would arrange for their grain to be trucked to the big terminal elevators at Salina.A K-State project updateDuring the visit, Linton provided an update on a project K-State has been working on for a number of years that he said would affect farmers.He said the university received money from the State of Kansas to support an agriculture innovation project.""The idea is to be able to build a $125 million integrated project which takes advantage of agronomy, grain science, milling, feed science, food animal, and food science,"" Linton said.The university plans to renovate Call Hall and Weber Hall into a new facility that also will support grain science and milling, he explained.""So Schellenberger will go away and we'll now be able to walk into a facility that says we are No. 1 in the world and we're moving forward,"" Linton told the group.Additionally, plans are in the works for a new agronomy research and development center that will be located by the agronomy farms near the football stadium, he said. The center will be two facilities. One to support laboratory research and development and the other to support field science.""The project will happen fast. We have to have all of the projects done by December 2026, which is when the state-directed dollars because of COVID must be spent,"" Linton said. ""So you're likely to hear about this project a lot over the next couple of weeks and couple of months. It's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to raise this industry.""""What happens at Kansas State University is among the most important things that determine the future for much of Kansas, and certainly our part of Kansas, and to have a dean of a college of agriculture now the president, that's a great development,"" Moran said.Linton smiled and said, ""Eat your Wheaties. Put on your crash helmet. Fasten your seatbelt.""Integration important to farmingKnopf said farmers are thinking more about integration, including integration into the supply chain.""We had Bimbo Bakeries, the largest baker in the world, I believe, at the Kansas Wheat Innovation Center, some of their upper management, not just a week ago, two weeks ago. So they were there talking about regenerative agriculture, but also just about grain quality, how the baking industry is changing, how the wheat varieties that are flowing in, wheat that's going into their bakeries needs certain characteristics, consistency so that integration across the stakeholders is increasingly more relevant,"" he said.What does that mean for wheat farmers like Knopf? It has become increasingly more important for Knopf to not only determine what varieties of wheat will do well on the types of soil his family farms while factoring in for potential weather conditions, bit also to determine what types of wheat will yield the types of grain needed for the baking industry.""Yield and agronomics has to lead that, but we will certainly make decisions based on quality when we're deciding,"" Knopf said.Farming a long-standing family traditionKnopf noted that he and his brother, Jeff, are the fifth generation of farmers in their family. They farm with their immediate families, and their parents, Jerry and Karlene. He also showed a grouping of historic family photos, talking about some of the farmers that came before him.The most fun dayBefore the group headed to the field, Knopf thanked Moran and Linton for their visit to the farm.""The honor is ours,"" Linton said. ""This is gonna be, I don't know if Jerry knows how much fun he's gonna have, but this is gonna be maybe the most fun day I've had since I've been at Kansas State. This is like comfort for me. So we're ready to rock and roll.""And with that, the group headed out to harvest some wheat."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/wall-street-journal,"Senate Broadens Benefits for Veterans Exposed to Noxious Chemicals: Legislation earns bipartisan support to expand the number of health conditions Veterans Affairs will consider related to military serviceBen Kesling | Wall Street JournalThe Senate passed legislation to expand healthcare and benefits for millions of veterans, especially those exposed to noxious chemicals.The legislation approved in the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 84 to 14 expands by two dozen the number of health conditions and diseases the Department of Veterans Affairs will consider related to military service, streamlining access to care and financial benefits related to their treatment. Known as the PACT Act, for Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics, the legislation is likely to be adopted by the House and could be signed into law before July 4, said officials familiar with the matter.“It’s 100 years overdue,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “My dad would have told you it should have been done to take care of World War II vets exposed to radiation. And my granddad would have told you it should have been done for World War I vets who were exposed to mustard gas.”Troops in combat zones commonly burn refuse that can include plastic water bottles, blood-soaked uniforms, human waste and used batteries. The waste is often soaked in fuel to accelerate burning. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some burn pits on large bases became notorious for their size and stench. The burn pits emitted noxious fumes that researchers have shown can lead to health problems, including neurological issues and lung cancer.While millions of deployed veterans have been exposed to burn pits, and a substantial number of them complain of negative health effects, the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs were slow to recognize the connection between illnesses and proximity to burn pits. Veterans who suffered from lung damage have had little recourse to get benefits or coverage for claimed illness.In 2014, the VA launched a Burn Pit Registry to allow veterans to document their concerns and to quantify the scale of the problem. In recent years, lobbying on Capitol Hill by comedian Jon Stewart brought more attention to health problems of first responders exposed to toxins on 9/11, and of people deployed in the military. President Biden has said he suspects his son Beau’s brain tumor and death were related to toxic exposure when he was deployed to Iraq.Along with the millions of veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who will be newly eligible to make claims, the legislation also recognizes health problems for veterans of prior wars. One is octogenarian Victor Skaar, who said he was exposed to radiation when he was ordered to help clean up the wreckage of a B-52 bomber that crashed near Palomares, Spain, in 1966. The plane jettisoned its bombs, and some of their conventional explosives detonated on impact. While the nuclear devices weren’t triggered, the explosions scattered radioactive debris. For years, he said, he has watched fellow veterans die and battled the VA in court to get recognition for the Palomares veterans.The Congressional Budget Office has said the bill could cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of expected healthcare and benefits claims. The VA also has a backlog of nearly 200,000 benefits claims even before the planned influx of burn-pit claims.Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.), the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said costs aren’t a concern, but the potential bureaucratic logjam at the VA could prove problematic.“The VA struggles to implement much less dramatic legislation than this,” he said, adding that Denis McDonough, the department’s secretary, has said the department is prepared for the expected delugeMr. McDonough said the department is already planning for the new cases.Advocates and lawmakers have said caring for veterans is an extension of the costs of war.“There’s plenty of money to send them over. There should be plenty of money when they come back,” said John Wells, chairman of Military-Veterans Advocacy."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/high-plains-journal,"State, local officials support construction start for Kansas soybean crushing plantHigh Plains JournalConstruction is underway on a $375 million soybean crushing facility in Cherryvale in southeast Kansas that will provide an important source of feedstock for producing renewable fuels, food products and animal feeds.Located in Montgomery County, the plant will be owned and operated by Bartlett, a Savage Company, and capable of handling approximately 45 million bushels of soybeans annually to crush into soybean meal and refined soybean oil. The Bartlett plant will create about 50 permanent jobs when operations commence in early 2024, and support additional jobs and economic activity during construction.A June 17 groundbreaking ceremony and luncheon were hosted by the Montgomery County Action Council in partnership with the Kansas Department of Commerce’s Office of Rural Prosperity to commemorate the start of this significant economic development project for the region. Participants included Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, U.S. Sen. Kansas Jerry Moran, Kansas State Rep. Jim Kelly, Director of the Kansas Department of Commerce’s Office of Rural Prosperity Trisha Purdon, Montgomery County officials, representatives of U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall and U.S. Congressman Jake LaTurner, and members of Bartlett’s leadership team.“We’re excited to start construction on our soybean crushing plant in Montgomery County. The facility will be an economic driver in southeast Kansas and expand markets for local soybean producers and agribusinesses,” said Bartlett President Bob Knief. “We appreciate the ongoing support from state, federal and local leaders, and look forward to serving a vital role for the food, animal feed and renewable fuel industries. We’ll support our nation’s transition to renewable fuels by sourcing up to 65 million gallons of feedstock for renewable transportation fuels annually, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 400,000 tons a year.”“Agriculture-based and renewable energy businesses are major economic drivers in Kansas, and I am extremely pleased to see Bartlett recognize just how ideal this location is for the future of their operations,” Kelly said. “Powered by Kansas’ outstanding infrastructure and talented workforce, I’m confident Bartlett’s new project will be a tremendous success and have a significant economic impact on the region and our state as a whole.”“The congressional delegation, on behalf of all of us, we are congratulatory to Montgomery County and to southeast Kansas for the success that this day represents—in the increase in opportunities for economic benefits to farmers and agriculture, for the communities for employment, for increasing opportunities to support transportation, and just an overall growth of southeast Kansas,” Moran said in his remarks. “This is one more example in which people roll up their sleeves and make something good happen.”“With our strategic location in the middle of the country and our strong agricultural roots, I’m absolutely thrilled that Bartlett chose Kansas as the place to locate this impressive new facility,” said Trisha Purdon, director of the Kansas Department of Commerce’s Office of Rural Prosperity. “We know they had other states in the region to choose from, so I am proud but not surprised that they selected Kansas as the winning location for this project.

The South Kansas & Oklahoma Railroad, owned and operated by WATCO, will provide rail services for the facility, connecting the plant to a network of Class 1 carriers.

After several weeks of specialized training in India in 1943, these 2,750 men fought their way through deep jungles, rugged mountains, tropical diseases, malnutrition, and a relentless enemy from February to August of 1944. Always outnumbered and often under-equipped, the Marauders engaged the enemy in five major battles and 32 smaller actions and inflicted over 5,000 enemy casualties, while marching more than 250 miles in some of the world’s most inhospitable terrain. By the end of the campaign, the regiment had been reduced to 130 combat-effective members, and only two men were never wounded or hospitalized. “Since the day we were born,” Johnie said, “except for two days in Burma, we were always together, he was always in the foxhole with me.”  Sadly, Louie Baima passed away in June of last year. “I look forward to seeing him again one day,” said Johnie. On Friday, Sen. Jerry Moran was in Pittsburg to present the Baima families with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals or institutions that can be bestowed by Congress. Less than 200 have been awarded, to either individuals or organizations, since its creation in 1776. Only five people have been awarded more than one. According to Moran, the medals were authorized by Congress in 2020, but because of unforeseen delays, it is only now that they are able to be awarded. The Baima medals were only minted barely more than a week ago. Sen. Moran, who never served in the military, punctuated the emotional event by recounting a phone call with his father, a World War II veteran of North Africa and Italy, shortly before his passing. He had just finished a walk to the Lincoln Memorial, which had taken him past the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. At the end of that phone call, he told his father, “I thank you. I respect you. And I love you.”  The Senator then turned his remarks back to the gathered family members and onlookers. “It is these memorials and occasions like today that allow us to say what we need to say to our veterans, ‘We thank you. We respect you. And we love you.’” Moran presented the medals to Johnie Baima and his wife, Lois, and to Michael Baima, Louie’s son."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/roll-call,"Toxic exposure bill would rewrite America’s compact with veterans: As many as 3.5 million veterans could receive new health care and disability benefitsMark Satter | Roll CallIn a year in which Congress has strained for legislative achievements, a big one is in sight. When senators return from a Memorial Day recess spent honoring those who gave their lives for the United States, they will take up a bipartisan bill that will dramatically broaden America’s commitment to take care of sick veterans.The bill would offer new health care and tax-free disability benefits as high as $3,332 a month to as many as 3.5 million veterans at a cost the Congressional Budget Office has pegged at more than $300 billion over 10 years.Under the legislation — crafted by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jon Tester, D-Mont., and ranking member Jerry Moran, R-Kan. — the Veterans Affairs Department would consider a veteran with any of 23 conditions, as varied as brain cancer and hypertension, who was deployed to a combat zone during the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan automatically eligible for care at government cost.By contrast, under current law, the veteran must demonstrate that his or her illness was the result of military service in order to qualify for benefits.Presuming a causeThere’s little doubt that many veterans were sickened by exposure to chemicals while they served, including smoke from burn pits in which troops disposed of garbage, such as medical materials and vehicle parts, by dousing it in jet fuel and setting it ablaze.The practice was widespread during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and medical experts say exposure is linked to a host of illnesses that can present themselves years later, including cancers, chronic respiratory conditions and lung damage.But for the better part of the post-9/11 era, the military did not keep thorough records of where burn pits were used. The smoke from the pits can also travel for miles, potentially affecting troops far afield. For veterans trying to prove that they qualified for toxic exposure treatment through the VA, it could be their word against the Pentagon’s.“I was in a very small, remote patrol base in southern Afghanistan, and we had a burn pit like everybody did. When I got out in 2011, there was nothing in my medical record that proved I was near a burn pit, because the DOD wasn’t tracking this stuff,” said Marine Corps veteran Travis Horr, the government affairs director for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, an advocacy group.The bill would also extend, from five years to 10 years, the period after veterans’ separation from the military during which they can seek out health care from the VA. If within that time period the veteran qualifies for care, he or she will continue to receive it indefinitely.Also in the legislation is an expansion of benefits for veterans exposed to radiation during the Cold War, an expansion of the list of illnesses linked to the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War and an extension of benefits to Vietnam War-era veterans who served in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Guam and may have been exposed to Agent Orange there.It would also greatly expand the VA’s physical footprint by setting up 31 new, major medical clinics across 19 states while hiring thousands more claims processors and staff.Legislative actionThe legislation largely mirrors, and slightly expands on, a House bill by Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Mark Takano, D-Calif., that passed 256-174 in March. President Joe Biden issued a statement at the time saying he supported the measure.Republicans who opposed the House bill argued that its likely price tag of more than $300 billion over 10 years was too expensive.The Congressional Budget Office projected that direct benefit payments for disability compensation would increase by $208 billion over a decade under the House bill, while health care costs, paid for through the annual appropriations process, plus VA administrative costs, could require an additional $114 billion. VA disability benefits range from $153 to $3,332 a month in tax-free payments, depending on the severity of the ailment.In February, the Senate passed by voice vote a narrower version of the bill that the Congressional Budget Office said would cost $1 billion over a decade. It would expand health care to more veterans who served in areas with known toxic exposure but wouldn’t provide disability compensation.House Democrats said that Senate bill wouldn’t help enough veterans — just 16,000 out of the 3.5 million potentially eligible Iraq and Afghanistan veterans — and declined to take it up.In the interim, Democrats argued it was not necessary to offset the cost with new taxes or fees, or budget cuts elsewhere, because of ill veterans’ pressing needs, and they derided the Senate’s original bill as stingy.A coalition of more than 40 veterans groups also backed the Democrats’ argument, while comedian Jon Stewart, who successfully lobbied Congress to provide compensation to people exposed to toxic air in New York City from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, joined the cause and raised the pressure.During a Sunday speech at a Memorial Day weekend event in Washington, Stewart said it was difficult not to be frustrated with Congress and the American people for taking so long to address the burn pits issue.“This may be one of the lowest-hanging fruit of the American legislative agenda,” he said. “Those that took up arms in defense of this country suffered grievous harm in that defense.”The new Senate bill would establish a “Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund” to cover the costs of the benefits it would create. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released its estimate of the bill’s cost, although it will likely be similar to that of the House version.Takano has said he’s satisfied, likely ensuring that the House will follow the Senate and send the bill to Biden for his signature."

Two of the reports raised issues with cost estimates and reporting. The VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act would hold the VA accountable and increase transparency by requiring the VA Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics and outcomes for EHRM.“The VA, and consequently our nation, has invested a great deal of time and money into the VA Electronic Health Record Modernization program,” said Ranking Member Moran. “The potential benefits of this program are important, and it is vital to get it right. Now that this legislation has been signed into law, we can make certain the VA is providing the proper transparency throughout the EHRM implementation. This will better allow the committee to conduct oversight during the deployment process to ensure veterans receive the care they deserve and hold the VA accountable for taxpayer dollars.”“It’s clear that VA’s Electronic Health Record Modernization program is not working for veterans, VA employees, or taxpayers,” said Chairman Tester. “I’m proud to have worked with Senator Moran and our colleagues to get our bipartisan bill across the finish line, allowing us to increase oversight and transparency on behalf of the VA medical staff using this program, so we can better provide our nation’s veterans the quality care they have earned.”Senators John Boozman (R-Ark.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), along with Mike Braun (R-Ind.), cosponsored the legislation.Following the release of the third VA OIG report earlier this year, Sen.

This historic and bipartisan legislation will deliver on the promise we made as a country to take care of our service men and women both when they deploy and when they come home.“The Heath Robinson Act will provide access to health care and benefits for millions of veterans who are sick from illnesses connected to toxic exposures.“When we send our warfighters into harm’s way, it is with the understanding that we have their back. When they come home bearing physical, mental or invisible wounds of war, we care for those wounds. Toxic wounds should not be treated any differently.“John Buckley, a retired U.S. Army Colonel from Andover, Kansas told me… ‘Our Soldiers were put into dangerous situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And many who suffered from their wounds or made the ultimate sacrifice have been cared for by our nation. Unfortunately, many too have been overlooked and ignored.  Especially those who are suffering injuries after having recurring and prolonged exposure to toxic fumes, burn pits and other environmental hazards.’“Another U.S. Army Colonel from Leavenworth, Kansas, Pat Proctor, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan shared that many of the men and women he served with are facing health challenges from being exposed to toxins while deployed. He said, and I quote, ‘There is no telling how many of us will be impacted as we get older.’“I know many of our veterans live with the lingering fear, will the toxic exposures from their service catch up with them and leave them with a debilitating disease. And if that happens, will the VA be there for them with the health care and benefits they need?“William Turner, the former Deputy Commanding General of Support for Kansas’ own Fort Riley First Infantry Division told me… ‘Our Veterans have served in multiple locations where they have been exposed to a number of toxins that have resulted in them developing serious illnesses, and they often struggle to gain access to health care and benefits that can help alleviate some of the pain and suffering they are experiencing.’“He went on to note… ‘It is absolutely imperative we pass this bill to guarantee expose veterans the permanent access to health care.’“Moving legislation through Congress can be a slow and frustrating process. However, this week when the Senate began debate on our bill, I was encouraged by the resounding show of confidence – receiving 86 votes.“We are now focused on the amendment process and will continue working as quickly as the Senate will allow to get this bill to the House and on its way to the President’s desk.“Whether Democrat or Republican, every member in this chamber represents veterans at home, and I firmly believe that every member in this chamber cares about our veterans. Issues related to veterans often have a way of bringing us together to find consensus.“We were able to deliver veterans choice through the MISSION Act, landmark mental health legislation through the John Scott Hannon Mental Health Improvement Act, and I believe we can do that again on this legislation to deliver care and benefits to all-generations of toxic-exposed veterans.“This country is good at recognizing the physical wounds of war. And we are getting better at recognizing the mental wounds of war. No longer can we ignore the wounds of war from toxic exposure—the wounds, like Agent Orange before it, that may not arrive until years later.“Throughout the remaining procedural votes on the Heath Robinson Act, I urge my colleagues with remaining questions or concerns to reach out so that we can all, together, deliver on this promise to those who have borne the battle.”# # #"

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/historic-toxic-exposure-legislation-passes-the-senate,"U.S. Senate Passes Historic Toxic Exposure LegislationOn Thursday, the Senate passed the most comprehensive toxic exposure package ever considered in our nation’s history. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 will deliver all veterans suffering from toxic exposure health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).Since September 11, 2001, up to 3.5 million deployed servicemembers have potentially encountered toxic exposures from burn pits. During deployment to a war zone, military personnel are often exposed to toxic hazards, many of which have been associated with chronic health issues. Until almost 2010, the U.S. military kept burn pits on bases for the disposal of chemicals, plastics, medical waste and other substances that were burned with jet fuel, creating toxic smoke.Currently, the VA can provide service-connected disability claims related to burn pit exposures. However, due to a lack of evidence, scientific data and information from the Department of Defense, at least 70% of claims are denied.As a nation, we recognize the physical, obvious wounds of war. We are improving our ability to recognize and treat the mental wounds of war, though we still have a long ways to go. No longer can we ignore the wounds of war from toxic exposures. Veterans suffering from toxic exposures have been relying on a broken system cobbled together through decades of patchwork fixes that often leaves them without health care or benefits.Over the past two years, nearly every veterans service organization (VSO) has testified before the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and emphasized the importance of fixing the process VA uses to provide health care and benefits to toxic-exposed veterans. Sen. Jon Tester and I have worked in a bipartisan fashion with these VSOs, veterans, advocates, the VA and our Senate colleagues to craft a comprehensive bill to deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans long-overdue health care and benefits.This bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.) as leaders of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee took a consequential step to honor our commitment to care for America’s veterans and their families and will provide comprehensive relief for all generations of veterans, from Agent Orange to the post-9/11 veterans exposed to burn pits during their deployments.Once signed into law, our nation’s veterans and their families will no longer have to fear being turned away the VA for illnesses related to toxic exposures.You can read my op-ed with Sen. Tester here in Stars & Stripes. You can also watch my full remarks on the U.S. Senate Floor before the final vote here.In Honor of SFC Heath RobinsonThis legislation is named in honor of SFC Heath Robinson, an Ohio Army National Guardsman who answered the call to serve our nation in the years following 9/11. He was a son, husband and father. After his service, he was diagnosed with a rare cancer caused by prolonged exposure to toxic substances. In 2020, the cancer cost him his life. Heath left behind an 8-year-old daughter, a wife and an extended family who are now committed to ensuring this country provides other veterans suffering from toxic exposures health care and benefits.For far too long, our nation’s veterans have been living with chronic illnesses as a result of exposures during their time in uniform. This week, the Senate took the opportunity to right this wrong and provide veterans and their families with the health care and benefits they have earned and deserve.What Kansas Veterans Are SayingThis bill is culmination of years of work, informed by veterans both in Kansas and across the nation. The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson PACT Act would not have been on the floor this week without the hard work of numerous Veterans Service Organizations, veteran families, survivors and advocates and veterans themselves who came to Washington to meet with Sen. Tester and I, and who testified before the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.Thank you for your service and thank you for your work in helping us deliver long-lasting solutions and comprehensive reforms for those who served our country.Lee Hursey, Commander for the State of Kansas Veterans of Foreign Wars:“On Behalf of the State of Kansas Veterans of foreign Wars, VFW and its 16,000 plus members and especially those veterans and their families that will be drastically affected by the PACT Act we thank and salute you for your efforts to get this bill to the floor of the United States Senate to be voted on. Your desire to get the best possible outcome for those veterans exposed to Toxic substances that could endanger their health has been noted and appreciated. Kansas VFW realizes the work that you do so tirelessly for veterans and all citizens of the United States and wants you to know that you are truly appreciated.”Jeremy Ehart, Department Commander of the Department of Kansas The American Legion:“The Kansas Department of The American Legion wholeheartedly endorses and supports the proposed legislation that Sen. Moran and Tester have worked in a bipartisan fashion with the VA, other VSOs, and advocates to craft the SFC Heath Robinson Act.”William Turner, Director of Kansas Commission on Veterans Affairs Office and former Deputy Commanding General of Support for Fort Riley’s First Infantry Division:“I greatly appreciate the extensive research and work that has been done by Senators Moran and Tester to effect legislation that rightfully would guarantee veterans who have been exposed to toxic environments and are suffering respiratory conditions, cancer and other associated illnesses permanent access to VA health care. Our Veterans have served in multiple locations where they have been exposed to a number of toxins that have resulted in them developing serious illnesses and they often struggle to gain access to health care and benefits that can help alleviate some of the pain and suffering they are experiencing. It is absolutely imperative that we enact the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Pact Act of 2022, as amended, to both guarantee exposed Veterans the permanent access to VA health care and also continue to establish a list of conditions that are presumed linkages to the toxic exposures thus enabling Veterans to receive their full benefits.”Eric Owens, Disabled American Veterans Department of Kansas Adjutant:“On behalf of the DAV Department of Kansas and our members, we fully support the Honoring Our PACT Act. It will provide healthcare and benefits to thousands of Kansas veterans that have been exposed to Agent Orange, radiation, contaminated water, burn pits and other environmental hazards. Many of our members are suffering from illnesses caused by these exposures and in many cases, they do not have access to VA health care and benefits. We are extremely grateful for Senator Moran’s leadership, bipartisanship and commitment to the men and women who have served this nation. The Honoring Our PACT Act will have a lasting positive impact on toxic exposed veterans, their families, and survivors. Again, we thank Senator Moran for his dedication to finding a solution to the puzzle of exposure legislation.”Lee Tafanelli, Major General (Ret.) and former Adjutant General of Kansas:“Our veterans have fought for this country. By no means should they have to fight the bureaucracy to get the necessary medical care they deserve. This landmark legislation fulfills the basic and sacred promise that we make to our veterans when we send them off to war. The promise that we will provide them the necessary VA medical care and disability benefits when they return must be honored. The legislation that you championed will have a great impact in the lives of our veterans long after their service. The knowledge that the obstacles formerly in their way have now been streamlined will provide peace of mind as our veterans move on with their lives. Access to the necessary healthcare for illnesses that have occurred as a result of their exposure to toxins during their deployment is an absolute necessity.”David T. Dennis, Colonel, United States Air Force (Ret.) and Sedgwick County Commissioner:“On behalf of all my brothers and sisters who wore the uniform of the United States to support and defend our Constitution, I strongly support the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring PACT Act of 2022. As a member of the Sedgwick County Board of Health, and the Chairman of the Sedgwick County Commission, it is our job to provide health services to those in need.  As a retired Air Force Colonel, it is my job to use my position to advocate for all active duty and military veterans. I sincerely appreciate your dedicated support for this legislation and for your steadfast support for our nation’s veterans.”Dr. Arthur DeGroat, Lieutenant Colonel (Ret)., U.S. Army, Kansas Governor’s Military Council:“As a combat veteran and military leader, I saw firsthand the effects of burn pits and its subsequent toxic exposure impacts on the lives of my soldiers. I have also witnessed many technical and manufacturing (packaging) innovations that would reduce the logistical waste that results in the primitive use of fire to burn refuse at great risk to soldiers, civilians, host nationals and the physical environment. This primitive martial practice must be stopped—and I feel your legislation will not only care for those effected—but improve the overall nature of combat deployments. Moreover, advances in military logistics will now have the impetus to innovate to reduce the waste footprint of harmful byproducts of wartime materials. I commend your expert leadership in this very important policy matter as both a veteran and citizen leader.”General Mike Dodson (Ret.) former commander of Fort Riley First Infantry Division and Kansas State Representative:“As a veteran myself, I have in the past given little thought to the hazards other than those presented by the enemy or those who would do us harm and what I might characterize as the standard health and safety measures we have practiced for decades. The first ‘non-standard hazard’ I encountered was ‘Agent Orange.’ The dangers were not known to us during our service in Vietnam, but certainly became an issue some years later. Likewise, in Desert Storm, while we were aware of some of the possible hazards (such as chemicals), the locations were largely unknow. The dangers presented by oil fires and burn pits were certainly suspected, but not easy to avoid. Servicemen and women have suffered various ailments and have long sought to have these hazards recognized by the VA as being causal factors. I applaud your actions and that of your Senate colleagues. This legislation will give hope to those veterans who are searching for answers to their suffering. It will also fulfill our commitment to them for the sacrifices they have made in the service of our country.”Herbert Schwartzkopf, Kansas VFW Adjutant/Quartermaster:“On behalf of Ransom VFW Post 7972, Ransom, Kansas, and the millions of United States Veterans out there, I wish to sincerely thank you for bringing the PACT ACT to the floor of the Senate for a vote. I know you will eventually do as you originally planned to get dates and dollars implemented into this bill so it will benefit not only the veterans and their families affected, but the entire nation. The work that you do so tirelessly for veterans and all citizens of the United States is totally appreciated and will not be forgotten.” Pat Proctor, Colonel (Ret.) U.S. Army and Kansas State Representative:""As a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, I know so many of my fellow veterans who are suffering from the negative effects of toxic exposure during their service in-theater. And there is no telling how many of us will be impacted as we get older. I am so incredibly grateful to Senator Moran for leading this effort, standing with those of us who served, and seeing that our nation meets its obligation to those who risked their lives in its defense.""Paul Chapa, founder of Friends in Service of Heroes:“Senator Moran and Senator Tester have my thanks and that of Friends In Service of Heroes for not forgetting our veterans. This is indeed a long time in the making and only pray it will save the lives of those that have suffered from the various toxic exposure. Thank you for letting them all know, that service mattered and still matters today.”Timothy Marlar, Colonel (Ret), of Newton:“It took too long for the VA provide relief for those exposed to Agent Orange. We cannot pass on the opportunity pass the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 and recognize the hazards of the exposure of military personnel to toxic substances. Our military personnel served overseas or stationed at home has been an ongoing issue. These exposures have resulted in conditions and illnesses among veterans which can have far reaching effects on health and quality of life of these heroes. I believe the PACT Act is move in the right direction towards honoring the service of our service members and providing medical treatment and disability compensation they have earned.” John C. Buckley, Colonel, (Ret.) U.S. Army of Andover:“I unequivocally support the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Pact Act of 2022. During my 33 years of military service, I sometimes had to order my troops to go into harm’s way. During training, I sometimes expected them to do very dangerous things. But before I ordered them to do those things, I assessed the risk and instituted the best mitigating actions which would ensure their safety and survival. Reinforcing my actions was my firm belief that we would take care of them, or their family, if they suffered an injury or fatality during any of these missions. ‘To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan.’ Our Soldiers were put into dangerous situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. And many who suffered from their wounds or made the ultimate sacrifice have been cared for by our nation. Unfortunately, many too have been overlooked and ignored. Especially those who are suffering injuries after having recurring and prolonged exposure to toxic fumes, burn pits and other environmental hazards.  Our country has turned their back on these heroes. These overlooked men and women are clearly suffering from the toll of armed conflict. I commend you for your interest in our veteran community. And I sincerely applaud the bipartisan effort and support to deliver the care to our veterans who sacrificed everything to ensure our country sustained its freedom and liberty. My Soldiers, our nation’s treasure, followed my difficult orders and directions because they trusted me, and they trusted that their nation would take care of them or their families if our mission went awry. Your Act will re-establish this trust that our service men and women, and their families have in our nation’s leaders, that they will honor the pact.” Wounded Warrior Project CEO Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Mike Linnington:“This toxic exposure bill will literally save the lives of countless veterans. Thousands of veterans and supporters made their voices heard on Capitol Hill. We want to thank every U.S. Senator who supported the vital legislation. Sen. Moran deserves a lot of credit for working in a bipartisan way to get this bill across the finish line. Now we’re calling on the U.S. House to quickly follow suit and send this bill to President Biden for his signature.”  Recognizing JuneteenthNearly two months after the Civil War ended, enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, learned of the end of the war and that they were now free. Kansas is known as the state “where slavery began to die.”Our state has an important history and role in ending slavery in the U.S., and this Juneteenth we honor freedom and continue striving to form a more perfect union.  Happy Father’s DayBeing a dad to my two girls is the greatest joy in my life, except for maybe being “Pop.”My dad was someone I greatly admired and looked up to. I want to wish all my fellow dads a happy Father’s Day.   Kansas City Scores World Cup BidThe FIFA World Cup is coming to Kansas City! Over the past five years, the greater Kansas City area has pulled together in remarkable ways to demonstrate to those around the globe that “We Want The World Cup.” And that hard work has paid off. I have no doubt Kansas City will be an outstanding host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and I look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to the heartland!  Oversight of the VA BudgetThis week, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee held a hearing to examine the Department of Veterans Affairs FY2023 budget request. This budget request sets another record for the VA at more than $300 billion for the delivery of veterans health care, disability compensation payments, educational assistance, veterans cemeteries and other programs. When we send our nation’s men and women to war, we commit to provide them any needed support when they come home, and I believe we must not shrink from delivering that support regardless of the cost. Our duty as stewards of taxpayer dollars is to ensure VA, in its request for funding and in its expenditures, has the resources it needs for its mission and delivers the health care and benefits veterans deserve in a fiscally responsible way. I was pleased VA Secretary Denis McDonough was able to certify to me and to our committee that VA would have the resources it needs to implement the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, which the Senate passed this week.A major factor in VA budgeting is how and where veterans access health care. The VA MISSION Act required clear standards for when veterans could choose between care in a VA facility or non-VA facility, along with a review of those standards to ensure they were meeting the goal of timely access to care for veterans. I shared my frustration with Secretary McDonough that VA has missed its deadline to share the findings of this review. Any consideration of VA spending on medical care must incorporate how veterans will access care in the community, and VA’s delay in sharing this information hurts our ability to deliver VA the resources it needs. Veterans, caregivers, and advocates have all become very familiar with the current access standards. We cannot allow bureaucrats at VA to chip away at the veteran’s legal right to choose where and when they get the care that best meets their needs. Supporting Emerging Aviation SectorEarlier this week, the House passed two pieces of legislation involving my efforts to support Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). AAM is an emerging sector of the aviation industry with the potential to create new jobs, transportation options and further develop economic activity.The first piece of legislation was a companion bill to my Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act. This bill lays the groundwork for the emerging AAM industry by establishing a pilot planning grant program to help prepare for the infrastructure needed to support these operations. It is a complementary effort to my Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act, which also passed the House this week. That legislation would instruct the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation to lead a working group comprised of members from nine government agencies to engage and work with the civil aviation industry. The working group would review policies and programs to help advance the maturation of AAM aircraft operations and create recommendations regarding safety, security and federal investments necessary for the development of AAM.Wichita leads the world in aviation, and both of the AAM bills will make certain Kansas aviation leaders have a role in developing policies designed to shape a new chapter in aviation. Discussing College Athlete Compensation with NCAA PresidentThis week, I met with the President of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Mark Emmert to continue our conversations related to the modernization of rules related to a student athlete’s name, image and likeness (NIL) rights. Since our last discussion, the NCAA adopted a temporary policy to suspend its rules related to student athlete compensation for the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).This decision by the NCAA to adopt interim rules to allow college athletes to profit from the use of their (NIL) was a step in the right direction as states continued to enact their own student athlete compensation laws. However, since the temporary rule took effect, many shortcomings have surfaced and further demonstrated that Congress must act to establish a consistent, federal standard on NIL. Creating a level playing field regarding student athlete protection and compensation through federal legislation will empower amateur athletes while maintaining the integrity of college sports that we all know and love.This is why I introduced the Amateur Athlete Protection and Compensation Act last year ahead of the July 1 rule change. My legislation would create a national standard of guidelines to make certain student athletes can benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness without hurting their eligibility to compete as a student athlete. While at the same time protecting the existing model of college athletics that has afforded so many young athletes an opportunity to pursue an education. Athletics teach young men and women many valuable skills that serve them throughout their life, and Kansas has an unparalleled history of college athletics that includes several premier programs attracting student athletes from all over the nation and the world. I will continue to work to ensure NIL legislation strikes the appropriate balance of empowering amateur athletes while maintaining the integrity of college sports that we all know and love. Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Kansas FFA StudentsThis week, I enjoyed speaking with Kansas FFA members participating in the Washington Leadership Conference. FFA is a great opportunity for young Kansans to develop their leadership skills and participate in hands-on agricultural education opportunities. Developing aspiring young leaders in agriculture is vital to our future as a nation. I look forward to seeing what these inspiring individuals accomplish in the future. Kansas Livestock AssociationOn Wednesday, I was pleased to meet with members of the Kansas Livestock Association. We discussed the detrimental effects high input costs, inflation, and energy prices have on our farmers, ranchers and communities across Kansas. Although there are no simple solutions, I urge the Biden Administration to reverse its anti-energy policies to provide much-needed relief to American families. KLA members also mentioned the extreme heat western Kansas has been experiencing throughout the pass week and the resulting cattle loss. My heart goes out to the cattle producers who have experienced this devastating loss, and I urge everyone to stay safe and take care of themselves amidst these sweltering conditions. Homebuilders Association of Greater Kansas City and WichitaI also met with both the Wichita Area Builders Association and the Homebuilders Association of Greater Kansas City on Wednesday. We discussed how trade barriers and excess regulations drive up the cost of housing, pushing more Kansans out of the housing market. At a time when all Americans are dealing with high inflation, lowering the cost of affordable home building is essential for economic prosperity. In order to sustain the generational wealth that can come with owning a home, we need to pursue policies that bring down the price of housing and expand access for Kansans of all income levels. I will continue using my position on the Senate Banking Committee to find solutions for affordable housing. Citizenship Washington Focus 4-H GroupI also enjoyed meeting with students from the Citizenship Washington Focus 4-H Group from Franklin & Osage Counties. My office was able to give them a tour of the United States Capitol, and I was pleased they were excited to discuss the history of our nation and learn more about how to participate in the democratic process. Capitol ToursIt was great to visit with the Davis family from Wichita while they were in the office for their tour of the U.S. Capitol. Welcoming Kansans to the Capitol is one of the highlights of the week.Wheat Harvest in KansasWheat harvest is underway in Kansas. We are one step closer to feeding a hungry world.On Saturday, KSU President Richard Linton and I joined Justin Knopf, President of Kansas Wheat, and his family to take part in the wheat harvest at their family farm near Gypsum. While there, Justin shared with President Linton and me how he works to preserve soil health on his farm so that the next generation of the Knopf family will have the means to grow plentiful crops that feed and fuel the world for many years to come. The importance of Kansas farmers and the crops they grow is more vital than ever due to the current food crisis created by Russia’s war in Ukraine. I will continue to do everything within my power to make sure that Kansas families like the Knopfs are able to pass along their operations to the next generation and are able to thrive in rural America. Thank you the Knopf family for letting me join them during harvest, and thank you to Justin’s son Andrew for letting me ride in the grain cart with him.Groundbreaking of SEK Soybean Crushing FacilityIt was great to be in Cherryvale for the Bartlett Soybean Crushing Facility groundbreaking on Friday. This $375 million investment in Montgomery County will bring 50 new jobs to the area and provide a new market opportunity for soybean farmers throughout southeast Kansas. Once operational in 2024, it will process 38.5 million bushels of soybeans annually.Bartlett has operated in Kansas for more than 100 years, and I’m pleased to see them once again expanding their footprint. It’s investments like this one that keep rural communities like Cherryvale thriving and offer opportunities for generations to come.I’d like to thank President Bob Knief and Vice President Bill Webster for the invitation to join this celebration. The groundwork to make this facility possible was a major group and state effort, and I appreciate the work of local officials, including the Montgomery County Action Council and Montgomery County Commission. Following the groundbreaking, I joined Bartlett employees and community leaders for a celebratory luncheon at the Cherryvale Community Center. During the luncheon, Bartlett leaders were able to give the local leaders more insight into this significant project and its progress thus far. When I was invited to address the group, I emphasized how important of a moment this is for Cherryvale and the surrounding area. The event Friday marked an important beginning to an investment that will continue to pay dividends to future generations of Kansans. Thank you to the Thompson Brothers for a great BBQ lunch. Progress on Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant CleanupOn Monday before heading to Washington, D.C., I visited the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant to review the progress of cleaning up the hazardous materials that were left on the site during decades of use by the military. From its activation during World War II to it being declared excess by the U.S. Army in 1998, the Sunflower Plant produced hundreds of millions of pounds of propellants used by the military in munitions deployed during the conflicts of the 20th Century. The manufacturing process created numerous locations within the plant site that require remediation due to the presence of hazardous chemicals. I have previously conducted oversight of the cleanup process, including when I held a Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee hearing about the site in 2017. I will continue to work with local and federal leaders to make certain this site is cleaned up in an efficient and transparent manner and will be ready for public usability.Thank you to DeSoto Mayor Rick Walker, DeSoto City Administrator Mike Brungardt, Army Corps KC District Commander Col. Travis Rayfield, and Jill Fraley and Kathy Baker, both with the Army Corps, for joining me during my visit.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."

https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/u-s-senate-passes-sens-moran-tester-s-historic-toxic-exposure-legislation,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Senate passed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. This legislation was introduced by U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) – the ranking member and chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. This legislation overwhelmingly passed the Senate with a vote of 84-14. It now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives and the President’s desk for signature.“As a nation, we recognize the physical, obvious wounds of war,” said Sen. Moran. “We are improving our ability to recognize and treat the mental wounds of war, though we still have a long ways to go. No longer can we ignore the wounds of war from toxic exposures. Veterans suffering from toxic exposures have been relying on a broken system cobbled together through decades of patchwork fixes that often leaves them without health care or benefits. Today, the Senate took a consequential step to right this wrong by passing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. This legislation will provide comprehensive relief for all generations of veterans, from Agent Orange to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans exposed to burn pits during their deployments. Our nation’s veterans and their families will no longer have to fear being turned away from the VA for illnesses related to toxic-exposures.”“Passing bipartisan toxic exposure legislation has been a priority for Sen. Tester and me, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue,” continued Sen. Moran. “Thank you to Heath Robinson’s family and all the veterans and advocates for their input and commitment to get this long-overdue bill passed through the Senate. I urge the House to quickly pass the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act and send it to the President’s desk to be signed into law.”Click HERE to Watch Sen.

Tester. “For hundreds of thousands of veterans, generations of our all-volunteer military and their families—this bill is putting us on a path to finally recognizing the toxic wounds of war. This bill is the legislation we envisioned when we set out to right the wrongs to our toxic-exposed veterans, and I’m grateful to Ranking Member Jerry Moran, our committee colleagues, Veterans Service Organizations, veterans’ advocates, and the Biden Administration for making this possible. Our men and women in uniform held up their end of the bargain, and I’m proud we’re holding up ours.”The SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act  will deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the first time in the nation’s history. For more than a year, Sens. Moran and Tester led negotiations between Democrats, Republicans, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, Ranking Member Mike Bost, the Biden Administration, Veterans Service Organizations and advocates.Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard. He died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. Among its many priorities, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will:As leaders of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sens. Moran and Tester have long been dedicated to identifying a path forward for unaddressed toxic exposure issues alongside Veterans Service Organizations—remaining committed to delivering comprehensive relief to all generations of toxic-exposed veterans.Veteran Leaders Across Kansas:“On Behalf of the State of Kansas Veterans of foreign Wars, VFW and its 16,000 plus members and especially those veterans and their families that will be drastically affected by the PACT Act we thank and salute you for your efforts to get this bill to the floor of the United States Senate to be voted on,” said Lee Hursey, commander for the State of Kansas Veterans of Foreign Wars. “Your desire to get the best possible outcome for those veterans exposed to Toxic substances that could endanger their health has been noted and appreciated.

And many who suffered from their wounds or made the ultimate sacrifice have been cared for by our nation. Unfortunately, many too have been overlooked and ignored. Especially those who are suffering injuries after having recurring and prolonged exposure to toxic fumes, burn pits and other environmental hazards.  Our country has turned their back on these heroes. These overlooked men and women are clearly suffering from the toll of armed conflict. I commend you for your interest in our veteran community. And I sincerely applaud the bipartisan effort and support to deliver the care to our veterans who sacrificed everything to ensure our country sustained its freedom and liberty. My Soldiers, our nation’s treasure, followed my difficult orders and directions because they trusted me, and they trusted that their nation would take care of them or their families if our mission went awry. Your Act will re-establish this trust that our service men and women, and their families have in our nation’s leaders, that they will honor the pact.”# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/calling-on-the-u-s-ag-to-investigate-violence-against-pro-life-organizations,"Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Calling on the U.S. Attorney General to Investigate Violence Against Pro-Life OrganizationsThis week, I led 15 of my colleagues in calling on U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate and work to prevent violence against pro-life organizations. After a draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked to the media last month, pro-life and religious organizations, including crisis pregnancy centers that assist women in need, have been vandalized and, in some cases, attacked by arsonists. Most prominently, a man was arrested with the stated intent to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his home.I am concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm, public stance and a proactive response against these violent threats. The Department of Justice must take all of these threats seriously, and I look forward to receiving their response. Read the full letter here. Update on Historic Toxic Exposure LegislationOn Tuesday, the U.S. Senate took the first step on the Senate floor to pass the most comprehensive toxic exposure package the Senate has ever considered for veterans – the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act. This legislation will provide long overdue health care access and disability benefits payments to veterans suffering from effects of military toxic exposures.When we send our warfighters into harm’s way, it is with the understanding that we have their back. When they come home bearing physical, mental or invisible wounds of war, we must provide the VA with resources to care for those wounds. Toxic wounds should not be treated any differently. I have heard from veterans across Kansas and our country about the lingering fear that the toxic exposures from their service will leave them with a debilitating disease, and if that happens will the VA be there for them with the health care and benefits they need.I am committed to seeing this bill pass the Senate and eventually be signed into law to help provide certainty to those who have served and make certain that they get the health care and benefits they deserve. Read more about my legislation to connect all generations of veterans with the care they need here. Watch my update on the U.S. Senate Floor here.  Inflation is Hurting American FamiliesOver the past year, inflation rose 8.6 percent and is sitting at a 40-year high, and just this week gas prices hit a national average of $5 a gallon. From day one, President Biden has undermined American energy production, and as a result the price of a gallon of gas has more than doubled. The hard-earned paychecks of Kansans, are being stretched thin paying for everyday purchases at the grocery store and the gas pump. I know from my conversations with Kansans soaring prices are at the forefront of everyone’s mind, and the Biden administration needs to take steps to prioritize American energy production and stabilize our supply chains. Introducing the Safe Schools ActThis week, I joined Sen. Roger Marshall in introducing the Safe Schools Act. This bill will allow schools to repurpose unspent COVID relief funding from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund to enhance their school’s safety and security measures, such as hiring school resource officers or implementing physical security measures like locks, panic buttons and video surveillance. Far too often, our schools are left vulnerable, and this bill would authorize existing funds to help keep students and teachers safe.Additionally, as the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the Department of Justice and its grant programs, I helped secure more than $120 million in the last two years alone for the STOP School Violence Program grants. As Congress works to address these problems, I remain committed to working with my colleagues to ensure our schools are safe. Conducting Oversight Hearings for Federal DepartmentsFederal Motor Carrier Safety AdministrationThis week, I had the opportunity to question Ms. Robin Hutcheson, the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) nominee. Each year, Kansas brings in thousands of head of feeder cattle from across the country to be grazed and finished. The electronic logging device (ELD) mandate highlighted the overly restrictive hours of service rules for livestock haulers and is an issue I have worked on as a member of the Appropriations Committee by supporting an exemption for livestock haulers from ELDs. It is critical these cattle be safely and humanely transported.The Department of Transportation’s hours of service rules must not create unintended situations that would cause harm or death to these animals, such as requiring a livestock hauler to pull off the side of the road with a load of cattle or requiring the off-loading of the cattle mid-trip. I was glad to raise this ongoing issue in front of the nominee for the Administrator of FMCSA and will continue to work on this critical issue through my role as an appropriator and my role on the Commerce Committee.  National Guard BureauOn Tuesday, I heard testimony from Chief of the National Guard Bureau General Daniel Hokanson, as well as from the service chiefs of our military’s Reserve component. My questions for the panel centered on starting a cybersecurity pilot program that would partner industry, academia and state and local partners with the National Guard to secure our critical infrastructure.I also asked the entire panel about their implementation of the MOMS Act, legislation I spearheaded to allow Guard and Reserve servicemembers to take maternity leave without it negatively impacting their creditable military service. Introduced in 2019, this legislation was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in 2021. To date, the Army is the only service to have implemented the provisions of the MOMS Act. It remains critical to me that this policy is implemented in each of the other services as quickly as possible. I thank our panelists for their service and all their work to keep our service men and women safe at home and abroad.National Telecommunications and Information AdministrationOn Thursday, as a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, I questioned the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Administrator Alan Davidson about the taxation of federal broadband deployment grants, the importance of using accurate data when providing funding for broadband deployment and the administration's departure from Congressional intent when drafting the rules for new broadband deployment programs.I was a member of the bipartisan group of senators who worked on the infrastructure legislation that was enacted last year, which included programs and funding to build out broadband networks to currently unserved Americans. These provisions were carefully negotiated by the bipartisan group, with many proposals considered and discarded. To see NTIA pick up several policies that Congress intentionally left out of the final agreement is disappointing and needs to be reversed to preserve the intent of Congress and ensure that these programs are able to provide quality broadband service to all Americans. Kansas Rural Letter Carriers Association ConventionOn Monday before heading to Washington, D.C., I spoke at the Kansas Rural Letter Carriers Association’s annual convention – their first in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and since the passage of the Postal Service Reform Act earlier this year. The bipartisan postal reform legislation was years in the making and an effort I have worked on since my earliest years representing Kansans in our nation’s capital.The Postal Service Reform Act would not have been possible without the advocacy efforts of KSRLCA, and I appreciated the opportunity to celebrate its passage in person with Kansans, discuss the process of its implementation and thank them for their irreplaceable public service. Even when nearly every aspect of American life came to a sudden halt during the pandemic, our letter carriers never faltered in their dedication to serving Kansans and our rural communities. Thank you for your service and to KSRLCA President David Troutman for the invitation to address the convention.  Meeting with Kansans in Washington, D.C.American Farm Bureau Women’s Leadership ProgramOn Wednesday, I met with Marieta Hauser with the American Farm Bureau Foundation Women’s Leadership program. As a resident of Ulysses, she expressed the challenges farmers are currently facing in regards to the drought in western Kansas. We also discussed the impact of regulations, high input costs and supply chain disruptions on the agricultural industry and rural communities across America. I appreciate the important role and significant impact women in agriculture have in Kansas and believe developing aspiring agricultural leaders is vital to our future as a nation.Flint Hills 4-HOn Wednesday, I had the opportunity to spend part of my afternoon with students from the Flint Hills 4-H Citizenship Washington Focus Program. These students came from several communities across rural Kansas, and for each of the students, it was their first time to Washington, D.C. I greatly enjoyed listening to these young men and women discuss the positive affect the 4-H program has had on their upbringing and discussing our shared appreciation for rural America. The George FamilyWhat makes Kansas great is undoubtedly the people, and my days in Washington are always brighter when I get to meet more fellow Kansans. I enjoyed connecting with the George family on their tour of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday.Discussing Support for Law Enforcement with the U.S. Deputy Sheriff’s AssociationI welcomed the United States Deputy Sheriff’s Association (USDSA) to my Washington, D.C. office this week. Headquartered in Wichita, USDSA is a non-profit dedicated to supporting law enforcement, their families and their communities. This support come in many forms, including training programs, equipment donations and End of Watch donations. Very little about being a law enforcement officer can be described as easy. They work around the clock and under difficult circumstances to keep our communities safe. The work USDSA helps ease some the burden of these difficulties.As the top Republican on the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee which funds the Department of Justice, I have made it my priority to make certain that our law enforcement have the resources they need to protect our communities. Focusing on areas in where there is the greatest need such as programs that enhance officer safety and wellness, addressing violent crime and drug trafficking, and modernization of policing technology. While these are just a few areas in which our law enforcement need assistance, much more can be done and USDSA is an important component of this work. I remain committed to working with my Congressional colleagues and organizations like USDSA to ensure our law enforcement is equipped with the tools they need to keep us safe. Announcing Federal Investment in FHSU’s Forsyth LibraryOn Friday, I was pleased to join Fort Hays State University and community leaders to announce a $17 million federal investment to support critical renovations for Forsyth Library. Libraries are an important asset not only for students seeking to advance their understanding of the world and further their education, but for the whole community as well. A larger, more modern library facility is needed to ensure students continue to receive the educational resources they need to be successful at Fort Hays. I’m certain that the federal funds announced will positively impact the students of FHSU in their pursuit of higher education and successful careers. Attending Kansas VFW ConventionAs I mentioned earlier, Congress is on the verge of passing historic legislation to address the challenges veterans face after exposure to toxic substances while deployed overseas. I was grateful to join the Kansas Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention on Saturday to give an update on this legislation, the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, including its procedural standing on the U.S. Senate Floor and the outlook for upcoming votes in Washington, D.C. this week.This bill is culmination of years of work, informed by veterans both in Kansas and across the nation. I want to thank the VFW for working with me on this comprehensive legislation and for their support of this bill. I particularly want to thank Kansas VFW Commander Lee Hursey and Adjutant Herb Schwartzkopf for their recent letters of support.  Storm Damage in MarysvilleYesterday I was in Marysville following Saturday night’s storm and tornado to see the damage to local buildings and the county health department. I’m thankful no one was hurt. I appreciated County Commissioner Barb Kickhaefer for walking me through town and all the Kansans pulling together to help clean up and repair the damage. Touring Russell Regional HospitalI appreciated David Caudill and Michelle Driskill hosting me for a tour of Russell Regional Hospital this weekend. We visited the recently updated emergency room trauma center and discussed the challenges rural health centers like this one face. Quality health care is an essential component of keeping rural America alive. Thank you to David and Michelle for showing me around and your insight, as well as all of the staff members who took time to speak with me. Read more about my visit here in KRSL.  Visiting TonganoxieI enjoyed stopping in Tonganoxie on my way to the airport Monday morning to check-in with local business leaders and residents. I appreciated my conversation with Mayor David Frese, City Manager George Brajkovic and Assistant City Manager Dan Porter. Remembering Veryl SwitzerI was saddened to learn of the passing of Nicodemus native Veryl Switzer. Many know of Veryl from his historic football career in the 1950s: the first African American scholarship player to graduate from Kansas State University and a Green Bay Packers halfback. But I knew him as a Graham County farmer. He was not only a trailblazer on the football field but also in his community, forming the Kansas Black Farmers Association and a youth agriculture camp. I respected Veryl tremendously for how he never forgot his roots, but even more so for his decision to put his NFL athletic pursuits to the side to serve our nation in the U.S. Air Force. Robba and I extend our condolences to his family and the Nicodemus community. Read more about his influential life here.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/sen-moran-leads-colleagues-in-demanding-answers-from-doj-on-efforts-to-protect-pro-life-groups-from-violence,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) – the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS), and Related Agencies – along with 15 colleagues today called on U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate and work to prevent violence against pro-life organizations. After a draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked to the media, pro-life and religious organizations have been increasingly vandalized and damaged.“We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats,” the senators wrote.“The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values,” the senators wrote. “We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate.” The letter was signed by Senators Steve Daines (Mont.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), John Boozman (Ark.), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), James Risch (Idaho), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), Ted Cruz (Texas), John Thune (S.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), James Lankford (Okla.) and Mike Braun (Ind.).This letter is supported by the National Right to Life Committee, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Family Research Council, Catholic Vote, March for Life, Students for Life and Family Policy Alliance.The full letter can be found here or below.Dear Attorney General Garland:We write to request information about how the Department of Justice is addressing the disturbing trend of harassment, intimidation, and violence against religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. While churches and crisis pregnancy centers have been vandalized, pro-life offices in Oregon and Wisconsin have been targeted by arsonists.  We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats.Last October, the Department of Justice wasted no time in publicly responding to threats of violence against educators and school administrators related to COVID-19 policies. You issued a memo in which you stated, “While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views.”  At the same time, the Department created specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators to help “potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.”  The Department also took steps to improve coordination between the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and local law enforcement to “open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response.”Yet in comparison to the current climate, in which multiple acts—not just threats—of violence have been documented, we have not seen the commensurate public response from the Department of Justice that the moment demands. The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values. We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate. We are dismayed that the open and public urgency with which the Department of Justice undertook efforts in the name of public safety last year is not being replicated currently to protect religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals. We seek answers to the following questions:1.  What is the Department of Justice’s strategy to prevent violence and threats of violence against private organizations and individuals who oppose legalized abortion?2.   What resources does the Department of Justice need to publicize and implement this strategy successfully?3.   What role has the Department of Justice played in investigating and prosecuting individuals committing violence against pro-life organizations and individuals? The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs is imminent, and thus we ask for a response to these questions by June 10, 2022. Thank you for your service to our country and your attention to this important matter # # # "
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/6/recognizing-kansas-wwii-veterans-with-congressional-gold-medal,"Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Recognizing Kansas WWII Veterans with Congressional Gold MedalThe Congressional Gold Medal is an award that represents the highest expression by Congress for distinguished achievements and contributions to the country. On Friday, I had the honor of presenting two of these medals to World War II veteran Johnie Baima and the family of his late twin brother Louie Baima.At 18 years old, these two southeast Kansas men raised their right hand and swore an oath to defend our country. At a time when siblings were often not allowed to fight in the same unit, they refused to be separated. These two served in the China, Burma, and India Theatre in World War II and fought through some of the thickest, most dense jungles in the world to push back against Japanese forces.As the Merrill’s Mauraders were killed in action or became sick, backup soldiers were sent to join this elite group of soldiers. Johnie and Louie were among the reinforcements sent to join the Merrill’s Mauraders.In 2020, the Merrill’s Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act became law to recognize the “bravery and outstanding service in the jungles of Burma in World War II."" On May 25, the Merrill’s Marauders Congressional Gold Medal was officially released by the U.S. Mint. I was honored to present these medals and recognize two of Kansas’ World War II veterans.Thank you to Lt. Col. Tim Senecaut and Pastor Rick Bartlett for helping me recognize these veterans and to Pittsburg State University for helping organize the event at the Veterans Memorial.Bringing New Space Manufacturing to KansasIn July 2020, I visited Fatih Ozmen, CEO of Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), and his wife, Eren Ozmen, President of SNC, at their headquarters in Louisville, Colorado. During the tour I received an overview of the Dream Chaser, their reusable spaceplane, and did a tour of their production floor. During the visit, I extended an invitation to host Fatih and Eren Ozmen in Wichita to witness our capabilities and see how Wichita could play a role in helping SNC achieve their goals.In March 2021, I was pleased to host Fatih and Eren Ozmen at Spirit AeroSystems and discuss future partnerships. Last week, Sierra Space and Spirit AeroSystems announced the formation of a long-term strategic partnership to further facilitate growth within the commercial space industry. This historic announcement between Sierra Space Company, a subsidiary of SNC, and Spirit AeroSystems is a result of those initial conversations in 2020, and an exciting first step in the partnerships to come. I’d like to thank Fatih and Eren Ozmen for taking the time to visit Wichita and see our capabilities and talented workforce first hand. I look forward to continuing to strengthen the relationship between our state and their incredible company for years to come.Stonepost Lofts Ribbon Cutting and Grand OpeningOn Tuesday, I joined the Hays community for a ribbon cutting and the grand opening of Stonepost Lofts. Formally Washington Elementary School, the school was purchased by Overland Property Group from the USD 489 school district and transformed into an 18-unit family housing development. I commend those who had a hand in making certain the school building didn’t remain vacant and sought to utilize the building to fill a need that every community in Kansas desperately has. In nearly every community I visit in Kansas, the topic of more housing comes up. I know well the important role affordable housing plays in the growth of our Kansas communities and businesses.As a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, I am grateful for the opportunity to help support projects like this one through a federal tax credit program to make sure Kansans have access to good homes. Thank you Overland Property Group, the City of Hays, USD 489 and all who worked on this project to help ensure that Hays residents have access to high-quality, affordable housing. I’d also like to thank Joshua Yurek, Director of Governmental Affairs for Midwest Housing Equity Group, and Matt Gillam, Managing Partner for Overland Property Group for the invitation to participate in this celebration. Celebrating 100 Years of Lions ClubAs a Lions Club member for more than 40 years, I was grateful to address the 100th Anniversary Kansas Lions State Convention Friday afternoon and celebrate the 17 Lions Clubs across Kansas that have served their communities for a century.Organizations like the Lions Club, which focus on service in their communities and around the world, provide a place to come together to make good things happen by working alongside our neighbors. I hope through civic clubs like Lions we can recommit ourselves to engage in our communities, in people’s lives and help address the challenges we face together.It’s important we preserve that spirit of “We Serve” to continue making a difference in our communities for the next 100 years. Thank you to Pittsburg Lions Club President Lori Horton for the invitation to speak and to past international President Ed McCormick for his kindness.Ribbon Cutting for Topside ManorWhile in western Kansas, I had the privilege to attend the ribbon cutting for Topside Manor Nursing home in Goodland. This new nursing home will provide quality care to seniors in western Kansas. Access to a nursing home in rural Kansas helps families stay in their own communities while being able to love and care for their aging mother or father. The people of Goodland came together and worked to meet a need they saw in their own community. When people work together, they can accomplish great things. Special thanks to Kansas State legislators in attendance Sen. Caryn Tyson, Sen. Rick Billinger, Rep. Adam Smith and Retired Sen. Ralph Ostmeyer as well as Ron Shilling, Kevin Rasure and Gennifer Golden House.Speaking at Colby RotaryThank you to the Colby Rotary for allowing me to speak to them on Tuesday. We spoke on the rising agriculture input prices, the foreign food crisis due to the Ukraine war, the importance of community and tech colleges in rural America, and making certain that our rural hospitals and small businesses stay open by providing adequate broadband and resources. I discussed how Rotary clubs like the one in Colby could apply for grants to help with the mental health crisis in rural America. Thank you Rep. Jim Minnix, Sen. Caryn Tyson and retired Sen. Ralph Ostmeyer for joining us. Thank you again to Jen Schoenfeld for allowing me to speak and to hear about important issues Colby is facing.Meeting with Fort Riley Leaders and SupportersThis week, I joined the monthly luncheon meeting of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce Military Relations Committee. As Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and a defense appropriator, I was pleased to share progress that has been made in supporting Fort Riley soldiers, families and veterans. This progress included the success of Irwin Army Hospital, the groundbreaking of new on-post schools that I successfully advocated for as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, as well as efforts to secure additional on-base soldier housing. I also appreciated the chance to provide an update on my legislation to address toxic-exposed veteransDuring my recent visit to Europe as a member of the NATO Observer Group, I was especially honored to share how proud I was of our First Infantry Division soldiers and the important role they played in training the Ukranian military. Thank you to Christine Benne and Janet Nichols for the opportunity to participate in today’s meeting. Thank you also to Fort Riley Garrison Commander Colonel William McKannay for sharing all that is being done to support military members and their families as they transition to civilian life, as well as to Deputy Commanding General Niave Knell for her leadership while Commanding General Meyer is deployed in Europe. Special thanks to folks in the Flint Hills region for the exceptional support they provide to our military community.Visiting Southeast KansasAnnouncing Federal Resources for PittsburgI appreciated the opportunity to help announce new federal investments in the Pittsburg community on Friday. Over the past year, I have worked closely with city officials and the Pittsburg Police Department to identify federal resources that will continue to help this area grow.These investments will help Pittsburg replace its aged water treatment plant and expand its capabilities to accommodate industrial growth in the region, preserving hundreds of local jobs and supporting the creation of new ones.Thank you to Pittsburg City Manager Daron Hall, Pittsburg PD Chief Brent Narges and all the city officials who worked closely with us to make certain these resources are used in a way that is beneficial to Pittsburg. I also appreciated speaking with the entire city commission and Kansas State Rep. Chuck Smith.McCune Farm to MarketIt was also great to stop by McCune Farm to Market on Friday, a family-owned grocery store, meat locker and restaurant that caters to locally produced goods. Last year, they obtained a USDA grant through a program I supported to obtain a federal grant of inspection, which will allow local producers to expand their market to a wider customer base.It was an impressive establishment, and I appreciated Connie Egbert for showing me their operation. Local cafes like this one are an important aspect of keeping small towns alive and helping reduce the food deserts in rural areas. Thank you to the Schenker family for your efforts and your commitment to southeast Kansas.New Federal Investment in Parsons Police DepartmentLater in the afternoon, I joined the Parsons Police Department, Fire Department, city officials and local leaders to announce federal resources for the community to acquire a force simulator for local law enforcement. This 360-degree simulator will play an important role in training officers for a wide-range of interactions they may have while in uniform.This announcement would not have been possible without local leaders voicing the need for this training tool. Federal investments are best made in conjunction with those that know their community best, and I appreciate their work to make certain federal investments are locally-driven. Thank you to Parsons City Manager Debbie Lamb for the kind introduction, Police Chief Robert Spinks for your advocacy, Public Safety Advisory Board Members, City Commissioners Verlyn Bolinger, Kevin Cruse and Eric Strait along with local leaders for attending and especially to the entire police and fire department for your dedication to keeping your community safe.Visiting ArmaWhile in SEK, I also stopped by Arma and was able to receive an update from local city officials and the police department on local happenings. I also appreciated catching up with friends at Fox Insurance Agency. Locally-owned businesses like the ones in Arma are what helps keep small communities alive throughout Kansas.Touring Veterans United Home LoansVeterans United Home Loans helps veterans utilize the benefits from their service to purchase homes and find success in their life after service. I appreciated the opportunity to meet with the co-founder of Veterans United Home Loans Brant Bukowsky. I appreciate the great work this organization does to serve our veterans and employ hundreds of Kansans.Addressing Kansas Agricultural and Rural LeadersDeveloping aspiring agricultural leaders in rural areas is vital to our future as a nation. On Saturday evening, I addressed the 15th graduating class of the Kansas Agriculture and Rural Leadership (KARL) program and welcomed the 16th class into the program. KARL is a two-year program that helps to prepare and connect leaders that are dedicated to positively impacting our agricultural and rural communities.The late Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, my friend and a giant in agricultural policy, was instrumental in helping launch the KARL program and supporting its development over the years. This was the first KARL graduation ceremony since his passing, but there is no doubt Dr. Flinchbaugh’s presence in ag policy will be remembered for generations to come through the thousands of students he taught and mentored during his decades-long career as a professor at K-State.Thank you to Jill Zimmerman for the invitation to speak. To all the KARL graduates: thank you for your commitment to Kansas; I look forward to seeing the bright future you help create for our state.Kansas American Legion ConventionOn Saturday morning, I joined veteran advocates from across the state at the Kansas American Legion Conference in Topeka. During my time in Congress, it has always been my intent that our veterans are given every opportunity to achieve that success after service, no matter what challenges they might face because of their service. That is why I am honored to have served on the Veterans’ Affairs Committees in both the House and the Senate, so I could work to make certain our veterans are getting the benefits and care they need.I appreciated the opportunity to provide a Congressional update on the historic legislation to address toxic exposure that Senator Jon Tester and I unveiled last month. I also discussed the implementation and oversight of the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act and the MISSION Act.I want to thank the Kansas Department of the American Legion for all you do every day in supporting veterans across our state. Thank you to Kansas American Legion Commander Marri Krupco and Department Adjutant Jimmie Foster for the invitation and all the veterans who shared their experiences with me.American Legion members play an important role in our communities, and many help honor and remember the fallen on Memorial Day. Last week, I received this photo from Laah Tucker, American Legion Auxiliary Unit 109 President in Natoma, of volunteers before placing hundreds of flags on seven cemeteries in the area.Last year, following the devastating flooding in Natoma the American Legion Hall suffered damage, and with it the flags they placed each year. During my trip to survey the damage in the area, I was able to donate 300 flags so they could continue the tradition of placing flags on veterans' graves. Thank you, Laah, for sharing this photo. Note: Fields marked with an * are required."

Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Remembering Those Who Served and Sacrificed on Memorial DayThis Memorial Day, we pause to remember, to honor and to pay respect to those who made the ultimate sacrifice.I hope we all took time this weekend today to reflect on the service of the brave men and women who fought in defense of our freedoms, our shared values and our way of life. As we reflect on their service this Memorial Day, let us remember what their sacrifice means and commit to living lives worthy of that sacrifice.Paying My Respects to Kansas HeroesOn Saturday, I began my day by paying respects to those who served our nation at Elmwood Cemetery in Lindsborg, Marquette Cemetery, Forrest Home Cemetery in northern Rice County and Bean Cemetery in Little River.At the Marquette Cemetery, I ran into Kirk Young, the local American Legion Commander and his family putting up flags. It’s a family tradition they have done for 15 years.Little River Memorial Day ParadeLater that morning, I participated in the Little River Memorial Day weekend parade. I was pleased to spend time with old and new friends and help Little River commemorate Memorial Day. Thank you to Kendall Hodgson for inviting me to ride with him. It was also great to meet the grandmother of one of the Kansas students I had nominated to attend West Point.Paying Respects to Father KapaunOn Memorial Day, I visited Pilsen – the home of Father Emil J. Kapaun. The church pictured here, St. John Nepomucene Church, was completed in 1915 and is where he was baptized in 1916. Father Kapaun became the first son of his parish to be ordained a priest and also served as an assistant pastor here.Father Kapaun’s story is one that is well-known in Kansas. After entering ministry, he volunteered for the Army and served as a chaplain in the Korean War. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in the Battle of Unsan, where he was taken prisoner but escaped to steal food from nearby farms to bring back to starving prisoners. He cared for the sick and injured and saved hundreds of lives on the battlefield and in prison camps prior to his death while a prisoner in May 1951.Later in the day, I paid my respects to Father Kapaun at his final resting place, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in downtown Wichita. For decades, Father Kapaun’s remains were unidentified, but in March of last year, I announced that the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency had positively identified him – the first step in bringing him back home to Kansas. In September, his home Catholic Diocese of Wichita was finally able to hold a funeral Mass and allow thousands of people in Kansas and around the world to pay their respects.A special thank you to Paul Babich and Father Todd Sheperd for their hospitality. Paul, who served on the Wichita Diocese Historic Commission for the beatification and canonization of Father Kapaun, and Father Sheperd could not have been more knowledgeable and gracious hosts. Father Kapaun’s story is one that continues to inspire me. One of the first pieces of legislation I introduced as a U.S. Senator was to award the Medal of Honor posthumously to Father Kapaun. On April 11, 2013, the Medal of Honor was presented to Father Kapaun’s nephew and attending family at a White House ceremony. Following the identification of his remains earlier last year, I introduced a resolution honoring Father Kapaun which unanimously passed the Senate in March of 2021. May he rest in peace.Resthaven Memorial Service in WichitaI was humbled to join veterans and more than 1,000 local residents at the 64th Annual Resthaven Memorial Day Service in Wichita on Monday morning. It was great to visit with so many of the attendees who came out to honor our fallen heroes. Thanks to Resthaven Cemetery General Manager Mark Hansen and his team for organizing this exceptional event. Special thanks to Commander of the 349th Air Refueling Squadron at McConnell Air Force Base Lieutenant Colonel Maureen Tanner for her inspiring remarks.Plainville CemeteryMy final stop this Memorial Day weekend was in my hometown of Plainville to visit my dad, a World War II veteran. I’m grateful for so many things he taught me, but especially for setting an example for how those in uniform are to be honored.My arrival coincided with the local crew taking down the flags. Thank you to Mike Toelkes, Dave Toelkes and Tom Nicholas for your work each year to display American flags at the Plainville Cemetery, along with all the Kansans who volunteer their time to do the same at cemeteries across our state.At certain times and certain places it seems like things are okay. This Memorial Day weekend – the ability to be with so many Kansans that love our state and country and took time to honor those who sacrificed to defend our freedoms – was one of those times. Thank you to everyone who allowed me to join you to commemorate this holiday, for sharing your traditions and for visiting with me.Statement on Uvalde School ShootingRobba and I are heartbroken by the display of senseless violence in Texas that took the lives of 19 children and two teachers. We join our fellow Americans in mourning the lives of the children and teachers lost to this act of evil. As the investigation continues, I will be monitoring the situation closely to make certain existing laws are being implemented and receiving the resources needed to help stop senseless violence.FBI Director Wray Testifies Before My CommitteeOn Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee. As the ranking member, I addressed the horrific school shooting and asked Director Wray of ways to better protect our schools, including whether additional resources are needed for legislation I supported, the STOP School Violence Act. This subcommittee has invested millions of dollars in the STOP School Violence Act since its enactment in 2018. These programs support school resource officers, “hardening” of schools, reporting hotlines, threat assessment programs and training for school personnel. The FBI Director must make certain these programs are being implemented and assess whether additional resources are needed.Additionally, we discussed the bureau’s FY2023 budget request, its counterterrorism work at the southern border and combating violent crime. The FBI has a broad and complex mission, therefore it is imperative that we strike an appropriate balance of fulfilling the bureau’s diverse responsibilities while targeting the highest needs and the greatest criminal threats. I will continue to support innovative and creative resources that help law enforcement engage with local leaders, build lasting partnerships and improve the health of our communities. I look forward to working with Director Wray and my colleagues on the subcommittee to best fulfill the bureau’s resource needs.The Crisis at Our Southern BorderI spoke on the U.S. Senate Floor regarding the humanitarian, public health and national security crisis happening at our southern border. In April, 234,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border – the highest monthly total in 22 years. The Biden administration continues to be absent in this crisis, and instead of offering constructive policies, they are removing ones that are helping prevent even more people from entering our country. Last week, the court made the decision to require Title 42 to remain in place. Ending it would create an even greater emergency at our border, and yet the Biden administration is appealing the court’s decision.One thing is for certain – our Border Patrol agents are doing an incredible job. They have a tireless, thankless job as they act as caretakers, law enforcement, medical professionals and so much more. I want them to know they are supported in the Senate, and we thank them for their service to our country.Questioning Chief of Naval Operations Regarding USS WichitaOn Thursday, I had the opportunity to hear testimony from Department of the Navy leadership in a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday and Commandant of the Marine Corps General David Berger testified to our committee on Naval and Marine Corps Readiness. I took the opportunity to express my concerns about the decommissioning of the USS Wichita, a Freedom Class Littoral Combat Ship designed for multiple missions, including minesweeping and antisubmarine warfare.I presided over the commissioning ceremony of the USS Wichita in 2019. I’m concerned that after so much investment in the Littoral Combat Ships that they will be retired after such a short time of use. I’m especially concerned about this because it seems the ships are still very usable for other missions without posing significant risks to our sailors. In March 2021, while working with Maritime Patrol Aircraft from the Dominican Republic, the USS Wichita interdicted smugglers in the Caribbean Sea carrying roughly $17 million of drugs. In response to my question, Admiral Gilday said that instead of completely scrapping the ships they might be transferred to our partners and allies to increase their fleet readiness. I will continue to discuss these plans with the Navy with the hope that the USS Wichita and others in its class remain useful to our maritime security and that the USS Wichita can live up to its motto “Keeper of the Sea.”Discussing NATO with Finland and Sweden AmbassadorsFinland and Sweden recently applied to become members of NATO, and I joined fellow members of the Senate NATO Observer Group in meeting with the ambassadors of Finland and Sweden on Tuesday. We discussed the process of joining and what obstacles each country may face on the path to membership. It is our mutual hope that all NATO allies will be in accord in time for next month’s NATO summit. As I noted with my colleagues on the Observer Group earlier this month, I welcome the addition of two highly-capable and enduring partners to join the alliance officially. Hosting the Aerospace Industries AssociationOn Tuesday, I hosted a Senate Aerospace Caucus event along with co-chair Senator Mark Warner. The event was to honor our Armed Forces, NASA and Department of Defense (DOD) leaders, and it was great to host them alongside members of the Aerospace Industries Association Board of Governors. I was pleased that NASA Administrator Nelson, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Allvin, Major General Finerty of the Air Force and Lt. General Wise of the Marine Corps were able to participate in this event. The relationship between businesses and DOD and NASA will only continue to grow as we continue to face threats to our national security.The following morning, I participated in a fireside chat Q&A during the AIA Board of Governors meeting. Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit AeroSystems, moderated the discussion that spanned a wide variety of topics, including my Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (AMJP) which helped protect about 5,000 jobs across the state of Kansas, hypersonic weapons development and the USICA/COMPETES Act conference committee. I appreciated the opportunity to offer a view from Congress to AIA’s Board of Governors and reiterate the importance of their partnerships with our government agencies. Meeting with Honeywell AerospaceOn Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with Mike Madsen, President and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace. They provided an update on their work and the importance of their location in Olathe, Kansas. It was great to catch up with Mr. Madsen and his team, and I will continue to remain an advocate for the important work they do for the aerospace industry.Strengthening U.S.-Columbia RelationsI joined a bipartisan group of senators to sponsor the United States-Colombia Bicentennial Act to provide a comprehensive bilateral agenda focused on promoting economic growth, peace, democratic governance and international security. Colombia is an enduring partner for the United States in our shared Western Hemisphere, enjoying 200 years of diplomatic relations. Given the region’s importance and the challenges we face together, this legislation provides the framework to deepen our cooperation and keep our region safe and secure.Discussing Association of American Universities PrioritiesI met with Barbara Snyder, President of the Association of American Universities (AAU), this week to discuss the ongoing competitiveness legislation conference committee negotiations. As part of the conference committee for the China competition bill, I am working with all of my colleagues on the committee toward agreement on a focused bill that reflects the research and development needs of our country to ensure America continues to be global leader in innovation. The member institutions of the Association of American Universities, which consists of leading research universities, including the University of Kansas, have and will continue to play a vital role in making our country more competitive, and I appreciate AAU President Snyder for sharing her insight.Remembering Porubsky’s Deli and TavernThis week, I spoke on the Senate Floor to honor Porubsky’s Deli and Tavern in the United States Senate.To someone from out of town, Porubsky’s Grocery and Meat doesn’t seem like much. But for railroad workers, Topeka locals and legislators from the statehouse who frequent Porubsky’s, it was the best place in town to grab a delicious meal and receive a friendly welcome. What the Porubsky family have been serving up for decades is more than just tasty sandwiches; it’s a place where you can go to know people and be known. And be known so well that your sandwich is made before you even make it to the counter to order it.”While I am sad to see Porubsky’s close their doors after decades, 75 years, of service, the Porubsky family themselves and their famous grocery will never be forgotten. I knew Charlie and Cecilia’s mom and dad, and I know Charlie and Cecilia well today. I thank them for being such good friends and for looking after my well-being and that of thousands of other customers over so many years.Welcoming Kansans to WashingtonHonor FlightThis week, I had the opportunity to welcome Kansas Honor Flight Veterans to Washington, D.C. These Kansans are Vietnam and Korean war veterans, and I was able to join them when they were at the Navy Memorial. It was an honor to welcome them and express my gratitude for their sacrifice and service to our country. Thank you to the Parsons High School students who accompanied these veterans and helped make their visit go smoothly.St. Ann Catholic SchoolI appreciated visiting with St. Ann 7th and 8th graders in the crypt of the Capitol during their tour on Wednesday. Washington, D.C. holds important history and democracy lessons for our nation’s young students, and I always enjoy the opportunity to speak with young Kansans during what is often their first time in our nation’s capital. Thank you to the teachers and parents that make these trips possible.Sacred Heart Jr.-Sr. High SchoolOn Thursday, I welcomed Sacred Heart Jr.-Sr. High School’s forensics team to our nation’s capital as they prepared to compete in the National Catholic Forensic League National Tournament. I enjoyed hearing about their season and the events they qualified for nationals in and was able to wish them good luck!Lake WilsonOn my way from Wichita to my hometown of Plainville, I stopped to visit with Kansans at Minooka State Park at Lake Wilson and to catch up with Michael and Paige Kraus, the new owners of the Wilson Marina.Remembering Jim LowtherJim Lowther was a gentleman through and through and had a tremendous impact on the Emporia community during his 92 years. I served alongside him in the statehouse for a portion of his two decades of service in the Kansas House of Representatives and am grateful to have called him both a colleague and a friend. Jim was a strong advocate for higher education in our state and recognized that investments in institutions like Emporia State University are an investment in Kansans. He lived a life full of service, the fruits of which can be seen throughout the Emporia community. Read more about his life here.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sen-moran-pays-tribute-to-porubsky-s-deli-tavern,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) spoke on the U.S. Senate Floor this week to recognize C.W. Porubsky’s Deli and Tavern after the Topeka family-owned business announced it will be closing after 75 years of business. “To someone from out of town, Porubsky’s Grocery and Meat doesn’t seem like much. But for railroad workers, Topeka locals and legislators from the statehouse who frequent Porubsky’s, it was the best place in town to grab a delicious meal and receive a friendly welcome,” said Sen. Moran. “What the Porubsky family have been serving up for decades is more than just tasty sandwiches; it’s a place where you can go to know people and be known. And be known so well that your sandwich is made before you even make it to the counter to order it.”“While I am sad to see Porubsky’s close their doors after decades, 75 years, of service, the Porubsky family themselves and their famous grocery will never be forgotten,” continued Sen. Moran. “I knew Charlie and Cecilia’s mom and dad, and I know Charlie and Cecilia well today. I thank them for being such good friends and for looking after my well-being and that of thousands of other customers over so many years.”Click HERE to Watch Sen. Moran’s Opening RemarksRemarks as delivered:“Mr. President, today I recognize a Kansas business that has served Topeka, our state capitol city, served, Topeka, for more than 75 years with hot bowls of chili, cold cut sandwiches, spicy pickles and warm conversations. To someone from out of town, Porubsky’s Grocery and Meat doesn’t seem like much. But for railroad workers, Topeka locals and legislators from the statehouse who frequent Porubsky’s, it was the best place in town to grab a delicious meal and receive a friendly welcome.“Opening in 1947 by Katie Porubsky and her son Charlie Porubsky, C.W, Porubsky Grocery and Meats was an iconic restaurant in Topeka and has fans around the country. While the grocery store portion was originally the driving force behind the business, it’s best known for being a spot to meet folks for lunch. Gourmet Magazine summed it up as well as anyone when it stated, ‘Porubsky’s is not just a place to eat. It is a destination in and of itself.’ Charlie Porubsky’s sons, Matthew, Charlie, Jr., Mark, alongside the Porubsky daughters Cecelia Pierson and Teresa Thomas have kept this business alive and have made their homes in Topeka.“Over the years the restaurant has developed a reputation of having some of the most delicious chili in the area. The start of chili season is a day their loyal customers look forward to year-in, and year-out. My personal experience with the Porubsky’s dates back to my time in the Kansas legislature. Several of my fellow legislators and I would make the trek to Porubsky’s during legislative breaks. Meeting from January through June meant that we had at least three full months to truly enjoy Porubsky’s hot pickles and spicy chili. With meat and cheese trays displayed, the restaurant was a warm respite from the cold and a welcome break from our political and governmental dealings.“Even today, as I travel across Kansas, I have a habit of altering my plans so that I can have a ham salad sandwich with three slices of cheese and a cold coke at Porubsky’s and enjoy the warm family hospitality. With my flights from D.C. to Kansas at the end of the week, when it lands early, I have the chance to make, during that two-hour drive home, to make the trek across the Kansas River up into North Topeka and go to Porubsky’s…and I will find wonderful people, great food, and a sense that I’m home, where all the talk is not about politics and not all of the Washington, D.C.  Insider conversation. It just feels like you’re around real people and real Kansans. While Porubsky’s and many other family-owned establishments like it lack the bells and whistles of nation-wide chains, the underlying quality, which truly matters, is the collection of people it takes to make it work.“The value of places like Porubsky’s can’t be measured in economic profits or Yelp reviews. What the Porubsky family has been serving up for decades is more than just tasty sandwiches; it’s a place where you can go to know people and to be known. And known so well, your sandwich is made before you even make it to the counter to order it.“Squeezing into a seat at the restaurant it doesn’t matter if you are Republican or a Democrat; it doesn’t matter where you come from; at places like Porubsky’s everyone is welcome.“While I am sad to see Porubsky’s close their doors after decades, 75 years, of service, the Porubsky family themselves and their famous grocery will never be forgotten. I knew Charlie and Cecilia’s mom and dad, and I know Charlie and Cecilia well today. I thank them for being such good friends and for looking after my well-being and that of thousands of other customers over so many years.”# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/breaking-senate-passes-bill-to-increase-transparency-of-va-health-record-modernization,"WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act of 2021, legislation introduced by Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) – ranking member and chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee – to increase transparency surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program. This legislation already passed the House of Representatives and will now go to the President to be signed into law.Last summer, the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) released three reports that raised concerns surrounding the deployment of the EHRM program. Two of the reports raised issues with cost estimates and reporting. The VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act would hold the VA accountable and increase transparency by requiring the VA Secretary to submit periodic reports to Congress regarding the costs, performance metrics and outcomes for EHRM.“The VA, and consequently our nation, has invested a great deal of time and money into the VA Electronic Health Record Modernization program,” said Sen. Moran. “The potential benefits of this program are tremendous, and we have to get it right. This legislation and soon to be law will ensure the VA is providing the proper transparency throughout the EHRM implementation to better allow this committee to conduct oversight during the deployment process to ensure veterans receive the care they deserve and hold the VA accountable for taxpayer dollars.”“Providing our veterans with seamless, high-quality care means making sure the electronic health record system is hitting the mark—for vets, for their families, and for taxpayers,” said Sen. Tester. “This bill is now on its way to the President’s desk. I’m hopeful he signs it into law without delay so Congress is able to exercise strengthened oversight over this program, ensuring it delivers lasting value to the VA medical staff and veterans who use it.”Senators John Boozman (R-Ark.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), along with Mike Braun (R-Ind.), cosponsored the legislation.Following the release of the third VA OIG report earlier this year, Sen. Moran released a statement available here and Sen. Tester released a statement available here. Sens. Moran and Tester also held a hearing titled, “VA Electronic Health Records: Modernization and the Path Ahead” with VA Secretary Denis McDonough.U.S. Representatives Mark Takano (D-Calif.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.) and Frank J. Mrvan (D-Ind.) introduced companion legislation that passed the U.S. House of Representatives last November.Bill text of H.R. 4591, the VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act of 2021, can be found here. # # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sens-moran-padilla-introduce-legislation-to-prepare-for-advanced-air-mobility-technology,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced bipartisan legislation to help communities prepare for the eventual integration of advanced air mobility technologies. The Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization (AAIM) Act would establish a pilot program to help state, local and Tribal governments prepare for anticipated advanced air mobility operations and ensure communities can take advantage of the potential benefits of the safe integration of these technologies in our nation’s airspace.Advanced air mobility consists of a system to move people and cargo between places previously not served, or underserved, by aviation. The new technologies allow for new methods of air travel, including electric vertical take-off and landing of aircraft. The bill is expected to be considered by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation this week.“American aviation is entering a new era of innovation and growth, and we need to make sure we have the right tools and infrastructure in place to keep pace with these developments,” said Sen. Moran. “Equipping cities with the resources to plan for and utilize this next generation of aircraft will help integrate advanced air mobility operations into existing and future transportation networks.”“As next-generation propulsion aircraft are poised to revolutionize how people and cargo move within and between cities, suburban, and rural areas, advanced air mobility technologies have the potential to transform how we link historically underserved communities,” said Sen. Padilla. “That’s why I’m excited to introduce this legislation to help states and localities keep pace with this growing sector. And I look forward to seeing this legislation move forward in the Senate Commerce Committee.”“The AAIM Act, offered by Senators Moran and Padilla, provides essential resources for state and local governments to prepare for their specific AAM infrastructure needs,” says James Viola, President and CEO of HAI. “The AAIM Act outlines a comprehensive set of considerations for infrastructure planning that will enable communities to maximize the societal benefits that AAM stands to offer. States and local governments across the country are eager to make the investments necessary to support new vertical flight technology. HAI applauds Senators Moran and Padilla for identifying this demand and crafting a thoughtfully-structured pilot program that will support the development and deployment of AAM infrastructure and provide valuable information on best practices that can be utilized in federal standards and guidance.”The AAIM Act is supported by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), the Helicopter Association International (HAI), the National Association of Counties (NACo), the National Association of State Aviation Officials (NASAO), the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), and the National League of Cities (NLC).Full text of the bill can be found here.# # #  "
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/reaching-an-agreement-on-historic-legislation-for-veterans,"Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Reaching an Agreement on Historic Legislation for VeteransFor far too long, veterans exposed to toxic substances while serving our nation have been denied access to health care and benefits through the VA. This includes many of the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans who have potentially encountered toxic exposures from burn pits – areas near military bases used to burn chemicals, rubber, medical waste, plastics, and other waste that would emit toxic smoke. As leaders of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Senator Jon Tester and I are committed to passing legislation to provide these veterans – and future generations of veterans – with the health care and benefits they deserve.This past week, Sen. Tester and I reached a bipartisan agreement for the most comprehensive toxic exposure package the Senate has ever delivered to veterans in this country’s history. For months I worked with Sen. Tester, the VA and veteran service organizations to craft legislation to provide relief to all generations of veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service. Together, we will continue working until Congress delivers on its commitment to passing long-lasting solutions and comprehensive toxic exposure reforms for those who served our country.Read more about the impact of the legislation in the Military Times.Demanding Answers from FDA on the Baby Formula ShortageAs Kansas parents continue to struggle to find baby formula in stores, I joined several of my Senate colleagues in asking Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf about the agency’s plans to address the shortage. The shortage comes in the aftermath of Abbott Nutrition’s voluntary recall of formula possibly connected to infant death and sickness, prompting an FDA safety investigation that temporarily closed Abbott’s Michigan formula manufacturing plant. The FDA is only now allowing Abbott’s plant to restart production of formula. Both the voluntary recall and the FDA investigation exasperated the shortage. I am awaiting Commissioner Califf’s response on the FDA’s failure to mitigate the nationwide baby formula shortage and the steps available to limit the harmful impact on families and their newborns.Read the full letter to the FDA here.Meeting with the Alzheimer’s AssociationAs a member of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, I appreciated the opportunity to meet with the Alzheimer's Association about legislation and additional resources needed to support Alzheimer’s research.Thank you to the Alzheimer’s Association Kansas Director of Public Policy Jamie Gideon and the many Kansas advocates who traveled to our nation’s capital and for their tireless efforts to eradicate this terrible disease. I remain dedicated and hopeful that through this research and these opportunities, we will be able to effectively treat and prevent Alzheimer’s once and for all.Introducing Alzheimer’s Research LegislationThis week, I joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing a pair of bills to cement and build on the progress made to prevent and help treat Alzheimer’s disease. I introduced the NAPA Reauthorization Act to reauthorize the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) through 2035 and modernize the legislation to reflect strides that have been made to understand the disease. NAPA was originally signed into law in 2011 and convened a panel of experts who created a coordinated strategic national plan to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 2025.Additionally, I also introduced the Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act. This legislation would set a requirement that the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to submit an annual budget to Congress estimating the funding necessary for NIH to fully implement NAPA’s research goals through 2035. These two pieces of legislation are vital to ensuring that research investments remain coordinated and their impact is maximized. Our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and the development of new treatments has made significant progress since NAPA was first signed into law in 2011. In my role on both the HELP and Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to providing necessary resources to help end this horrible disease.Supporting Aid for Ukraine and National SecurityThe Ukrainian people and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have demonstrated tremendous courage as they continue to defend their homeland against Russia’s unjust invasion. Last week, I voted to support the Ukraine Supplemental Aid Package to provide weapons, valuable intelligence, medical supplies and humanitarian assistance to bolster Ukraine and send a message to authoritarian regimes that attacks against democracy will not go unanswered. Our NATO allies should also increasingly demonstrate their commitment to freedom and security by matching America’s support to defend Ukraine and to deter further Russian aggression in Europe. If Russian aggression goes unchecked, the cost could be much greater – both fiscally and in devastating casualties. Additionally, this legislation includes an investment in our own national security by allocating resources to purchase more weapons to bolster our defense capabilities here at home. We must recognize that we have adversaries who seek to use force to destabilize our country and our allies and partners. We have a duty to answer these threats to preserve American security and prosperity.Briefing on U.S. Military Support in Eastern EuropeThis week, I met with General Christopher Cavoli, the Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, at my office in Washington, D.C. When I visited Germany and Poland in March, I met General Cavoli, and I was pleased to receive an update from him on the war in Ukraine since our last meeting. His on-the-ground perspective helped me better understand the challenges our partners in Ukraine face on a daily basis. He reiterated the supplies we are sending to our Ukrainian allies are crucial to their ability to fight – and win – this unprovoked war initiated by Vladimir Putin. European deterrence is working, and I intend to continue to provide fiscally responsible support that will aid these determined Ukrainian soldiers and our American servicemembers, like those of Ft. Riley’s 1st Infantry Division, that are training them. I am thankful for General Cavoli’s service to his nation and his willingness to visit Washington, D.C. to brief members of Congress during these tumultuous times. Reopening our Embassy in Kyiv, UkraineOn Wednesday, the Biden Administration re-opened America’s embassy in Kyiv. I sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month encouraging the re-opening to enhance cooperation with Ukraine and reinforce America’s full support for a Ukraine whole and free. In addition to this welcome development, the Senate unanimously confirmed Ambassador Bridget Brink to lead the embassy in Kyiv. The post had been vacant since 2019, and I’m pleased the Senate moved quickly after President Biden submitted her nomination last month.Greater Kansas City Chamber of CommerceOn Wednesday, I met with members of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce to discuss issues facing their businesses and provide an update on what is happening in Congress. The group was particularly interested in the ongoing conference committee process to come to an agreement on research and global competition legislation. My priorities for this conference committee are to bring opportunities for research and economic growth to Kansas and make certain the final product is focused on increasing U.S. competitiveness with China and other adversarial nations. I appreciate the chamber’s work in Kansas City and look forward to continuing to work with the chamber and its members to increase the economic standing of the region.Traveling Vietnam Wall comes to Kansas CityOn my way back from Washington, D.C., I had the honor to join veterans and members of the community in Kansas City to recognize the arrival of the Vietnam Traveling Wall. This memorial is a special way to bring a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. to veterans and their families in our own community.Each name on the wall represents a vital and loved part of a family, a marriage and a community that was lost. A son, a spouse, a brother, a friend who did not come home. In vowing to never forget their sacrifice, we honor in perpetuity those who gave their lives for our country.I want to thank Robert M. Dudley, a retired U.S. Army Colonel, for sharing with me what the wall meant to him. I hope many in the Kansas City region will have the opportunity to visit the wall set up at the World War I Museum and Memorial through Memorial Day and say thank you to the thousands of Vietnam veterans who deserve our gratitude, love and respect.Big Brothers Big Sisters in WashingtonOn Wednesday, I met with Mary Shannon, the President and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of Kansas. We spoke about the work BBBS is doing to provide our youth with positive role models and setting them up for success in the future, as well as the importance of federal assistance through the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Programs (OJJDP) at the Department of Justice (DOJ). For nearly one hundred years, Big Brothers Big Sisters has played an important role in our communities by providing mentorship to our youth who have often faced overwhelming adversity. Each year, their one-on-one mentoring program provides thousands of young Kansans with a positive role model and a friend to help them through tough times and set them on a path to success.As the top Republican on the Senate Appropriation subcommittee, which funds grants used by BBBS, I remain committed to assisting Big Brothers Big Sisters in their work of providing many young people with a positive role model and better opportunities. Thank you to Big Brothers Big Sisters and all who are involved for your dedication to making a life better for our youth.Welcoming KU's ChancellorI was pleased to talk with KU Chancellor Douglas Girod and other university leaders on Tuesday. We discussed updates regarding the university and issues that are important on their campus. I was able to congratulate the Chancellor on their men’s basketball NCAA national championship win and commended him on the completion of a successful school year.Recognizing Lions Club InternationalI was pleased to host Lions Clubs International – the world’s largest service organization – for a reception in the Senate this week. Civic organizations like Lions Club contribute greatly to communities around the world and in Kansas, with more than 200 clubs and 6,000 members in our state. With a focus on service, they have equipped Americans for more than 100 years to serve their communities and meet humanitarian needs.I have been a Lions Club member for 40 years, and I appreciated the opportunity to speak with Lions Club International President Douglas Alexander and the other organization leaders who traveled to our nation’s capital. Thank you for the pin and for presenting me with a “Journey of Peace,” a winning poster from the International Peace Poster Contest held annually. Speaking with Kansas ProducersNelson Poultry FarmsOn Thursday, I met with Greg Nelson, who owns Nelson Poultry Farms in Manhattan. We were able to discuss issues affecting egg producers, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), egg pricing, agricultural labor issues and the negative impact of high input costs. We discussed the importance of getting young people involved in the poultry industry and how we can help create opportunities for individuals interested in joining the industry. Investing in a new generation of producers is incredibly important to ensure the stability of our agricultural workforce.Keesling FarmsOn Wednesday, I met with Doug Keesling of Keesling Farms in Chase and the President and CEO of Kansas Global Trade Services Laura Lombard, who lives in Wichita. We talked about the influence of China in North Africa and how American businesses can help individuals in North Africa dealing with food insecurity. Feeding hungry people is, most importantly, the morally right thing to do and will foster goodwill and political stability in countries facing famine, hunger and starvation.Meeting with Intel CEOLast week, I met with Pat Gelsinger, the CEO of Intel, to discuss the CHIPS for America Act and the conference committee on legislation to increase American global competitiveness in key technology areas. The CHIPS for America Act would provide funds to return semiconductor manufacturing capacity and semiconductor research to the U.S. Mr. Gelsinger relayed the importance of this legislation receiving funding soon, and we discussed the differences between the Senate-passed, bipartisan United States Innovation and Competition Act and the House-passed, partisan America COMPETES Act. As a member of the conference committee that is working on reconciling the differences between these bills, I will work to pass legislation that is focused on improving our research and development capability in semiconductors and other key technology areas, like artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.Urging Commerce to Stop Delaying Offshore Drilling PermitsThis past week, I urged Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to stop delaying permits for offshore oil and gas companies performing exploration work ahead of drilling wells. A mathematical error at the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has caused a delay in issuing permits required to bring additional production online from existing federal oil and gas leases. At a time when prices at the pump are hitting record highs, Americans are suffering from the highest inflation in forty years. These high input costs hurt the Kansas agricultural community and only worsen supply chain backups. The Department of Commerce should work to fix this error and encourage domestic energy production as a key way to fight inflation, support American jobs and reduce our dependence on adversaries for energy sources. Questioning NIH on Cancer ResearchLast week, an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) FY2023 budget request allowed me the chance to visit with Acting NIH Director, Dr. Lawrence Tabak. Congress recently authorized the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which will focus on accelerated, high-risk research for cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. Dr. Tabak and I discussed how NIH can ensure ARPA-H will not be duplicating work already being conducted at NIH.The NIH FY2023 budget request also cut funding to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) by 2.9% in order to allocate increased funds to ARPA-H. I expressed my concern to Dr. Tabak about this funding tradeoff since ARPA-H is a yet untested model in biomedical research, and cuts to NCI would limit our ability to strengthen competitive cancer grants with medical research institutions in Kansas and across the country. Dr. Tabak explained the proposed funding for NCI was not based on the recently passed FY2022 appropriations levels, and NIH does not intend to decrease prioritization for NCI funding from the NIH budget.Vetting Nominees on Overreaching Climate PoliciesOn Thursday, the Banking Committee considered Michael Barr to be Vice Chair of Supervision at the Federal Reserve and Jaime Lizarraga and Mark Uyeda to be Commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I questioned the SEC nominees regarding the impact that the commission’s proposed climate disclosure requirements would have on small businesses. The anticipated rules regarding Scope 3 emissions will have significant negative downstream effects on millions of small businesses. I was pleased that both nominees agreed the SEC should fully consider the effects of these rules on America’s small businesses. Additionally, I asked Mr. Barr about preserving banks’ ability to be adequately prepare for future financial stresses. Banks played a key role in allowing businesses and families to stay afloat during the pandemic, and I will continue working to ensure Kansas banks are able to best support their local communities.Recognizing National Police Week I joined my colleagues in introducing and adopting a resolution marking National Police Week and reiterating support for the men and women in law enforcement. Our men and women in blue go above and beyond the call of duty to keep our communities safe. Today, and every day, we thank our law enforcement for their commitment to protect others and for answering the call to serve. I will always back the blue and want our law enforcement officers to know that we care about them; we respect them; and we’ve got your six.Barring Funds for President Biden’s Disinformation BoardThe Biden administration’s move to establish a Disinformation Governance Board within the Department of Homeland Security was a threat to the First Amendment rights of all Americans. Our country’s founding was grounded in opposing viewpoints, and we have long been a country that welcomes a “free marketplace of ideas.”While the administration has put the board “on pause,” I joined legislation earlier this week to bar federal funds from ever being used for its establishment or to support its activities to make certain it never becomes reality.Welcoming Fort Riley Commanding GeneralOn Friday, I had the opportunity to attend the Fort Riley First Infantry Division Commanding General’s Annual Barbeque where I joined members of the community in welcoming Major General John V. Meyer III to his new leadership post. General Meyer recently served as the G3 Operations Chief for the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa—experiences that will serve him well as Big Red One soldiers continue to serve with distinction across Europe and particularly on the eastern flank of NATO countries. I look forward to working with General Meyer to make certain our men and women in uniform, as well as their families, have the resources they need. A special thanks to the many members of the community who showed up in support of General Meyer and his family. KCK Chamber Congressional ForumOn Friday, I had the opportunity to speak to and take questions from the attendees of the KCK Chamber of Commerce 3rd Congressional district lunch. This public policy series was started in 1954 and features local, state and federal representatives speaking on issues relevant to the area’s business community.I discussed the success we have had in bringing new economic developments to the Kansas City area. This past year, I secured $16 million in funding for equipment for the KU Cancer Center which will be useful as they embark on their plan to create a $500 million premiere Cancer Center in Kansas City, Kansas. Recently, Urban Outfitters chose Wyandotte County to build an 880,000-sqaure-foot distribution center on land at the Kansas Speedway. This new facility will bring 1,970 new, good-paying jobs and $400 million in capital investment into Kansas. I worked closely with Kansas Department of Commerce to connect with Urban Outfitters, as we worked together to bring this business to Kansas. Thank you to President and CEO Daniel Silva for the invitation to join you and to the attendees for the insightful questions relevant to the business community.Touring Johnson County Community College On my way back to Washington, D.C. on Monday, I stopped at Johnson County Community College to visit with President Andrey Bowne and tour the Hugh L. Libby Center and Technical Education Center. This new center will help provide technical training for automotive, electrical, HVAC and plumbing engineering and technology. Thank you to President Bowne for the warm welcome and for sharing ways the college is shaping students.Supporting Kansas Airports This week, I announced 23 U.S. Department of Transportation grants for Kansas airports. These resources will be used to make necessary repairs and upgrades. Our local airports provide pivotal economic opportunities and resources to communities across our state. Investments such as these make certain our rural airports are operating safely and efficiently to support interstate commerce and travel to and from Kansas, and ensures local residents are equipped with services similar to those of our urban cities.Honored to Serve You in WashingtonIt is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard. Please let me know how I can be of assistance. You can contact me by email by clicking here. You can also click here to contact me through one of my Kansas offices or my Washington, D.C. office.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sen-moran-statement-on-support-for-ukraine,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) – a member of the Senate NATO Observer Group – today released the following statement after voting to pass the Ukraine Supplemental Aid Package:“The Ukrainian people and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have demonstrated tremendous courage as they continue to defend their homeland against Russia’s unjust invasion. Our commitment to help the Ukrainians to not just survive but to win this war also demonstrates our commitment to our own country’s security. Providing weapons, valuable intelligence, medical supplies and humanitarian assistance will bolster Ukraine and send a message to authoritarian regimes that attacks against democracy will not go unanswered. Our NATO allies should also increasingly demonstrate their commitment to freedom and security by matching America’s support to defend Ukraine and to deter further Russian aggression in Europe. If Russian aggression goes unchecked, the cost could be much greater – both fiscally and in devastating casualties.“In addition, this legislation includes an investment in our own national security by allocating resources to purchase more weapons to bolster our defense capabilities here at home. We must recognize that we have adversaries who seek to use force to destabilize our country and our allies and partners. We have a duty to answer these threats to preserve American security and prosperity.”Sen. Moran traveled to Germany and Poland in March to meet with NATO leaders, Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian aid workers. This bill passed the Senate (86-11).# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sens-moran-tester-announce-bipartisan-agreement-on-historic-toxic-exposure-legislation,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) – Ranking Member and Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC) – today announced a bipartisan agreement on comprehensive legislation to deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans their earned health care and benefits under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the first time in the nation’s history.For more than a year, Sens. Moran and Tester led negotiations between Democrats, Republicans, House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, Ranking Member Mike Bost, the Biden administration and Veterans Service Organizations that resulted in today’s agreement—the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. The senators released the following statement:“This bipartisan legislation is the most comprehensive toxic exposure package the Senate has ever delivered to veterans in this country’s history. For far too long, our nation’s veterans have been living with chronic illnesses as a result of exposures during their time in uniform. Today, we’re taking necessary steps to right this wrong with our proposal that’ll provide veterans and their families with the health care and benefits they have earned and deserve. In addition to providing historic relief to all generations of toxic-exposed veterans, this legislation will improve claims processing to meet the immediate and future needs of every veteran it serves. Together, we will continue working until Congress delivers on its commitment to passing long-lasting solutions and comprehensive reforms for those who served our country.”Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson deployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the Ohio National Guard. He died in 2020 from toxic exposure as a result of his military service. Among its many priorities, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022 will: As leaders of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sens. Moran and Tester have long been dedicated to identifying a path forward for unaddressed toxic exposure issues alongside Veterans Service Organizations—remaining committed to delivering comprehensive relief to all generations of toxic-exposed veterans. Once bill text has been finalized, it will be put on the floor for a vote—with senators expressing urgency that a Senate floor vote take place as soon as possible. After Senate passage, the legislation must be passed by the House before being signed into law by the President.# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/shaheen-tillis-lead-senate-nato-observer-group-in-joint-statement-of-support-for-finland-sweden-accession,"WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, and Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) led the bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in a joint statement of support for Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO in response to the respective nations announcing their intent to join the transatlantic alliance:“The Senate NATO Observer Group welcomes today’s announcement by Finland and Sweden that they will begin the formal application process to join the NATO Alliance in pursuit of peace and prosperity in Europe. NATO has helped preserve our world order for more than 70 years, but as Putin’s campaign of violence in Ukraine continues and as he looks elsewhere to spread his malign influence, Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO at this moment is paramount to countering his threats to global security, and especially to nearby, vulnerable nations,” said the Senators. “Finland and Sweden are longstanding NATO partners who already share the collective values that guide our alliance. This demonstration of their intent proves that there are different paths to NATO membership, and we welcome the addition of two highly-capable and enduring partners to join the alliance officially.”The Senate NATO Observer Group was first established over twenty years ago in 1997 by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) and Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) to serve as a connection between the Administration, NATO and the U.S. Senate. After being disbanded in 1997 due to a lack of NATO enlargement rounds, Shaheen and Tillis re-established the Group in 2018 with an expanded mission to closely monitor and inform Senators outside of national security committees about defense spending commitments of Alliance members, the process of upgrading military capabilities, the Alliance’s counter-terrorism capability, NATO enlargement and the ability of NATO member states to address non-conventional warfare. The Group has 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans, including U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.).###"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/sen-moran-joins-colleagues-in-introducing-bills-to-bolster-alzheimer-s-research,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (Kan.) – a member of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s disease – joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing a pair of bills to cement and build on the progress made to prevent and help treat Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimer’s disease costs the U.S. $321 billion per year, including $206 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. Alzheimer’s is projected to affect 12.7 million seniors and nearly surpass $1 trillion in annual costs by 2050. In 2021, family caregivers provided 16 billion hours of unpaid care for loved ones with dementia. Nearly half of baby boomers reaching age 85 will either be afflicted with Alzheimer’s or caring for someone who has it.“Our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and the development of new treatments has made significant progress since the National Alzheimer’s Project Act was first signed into law in 2011,” said Sen. Moran. “In my role on both the HELP and Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to providing necessary resources so we not only maintain NAPA’s progress but expand it to help end this horrible disease.”In 2011 after being signed into law, the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) convened a panel of experts, who created a coordinated strategic national plan to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease by 2025. The law is set to expire soon and must be reauthorized to ensure that research investments remain coordinated and their impact is maximized.The NAPA Reauthorization Act—authored by Sens. Moran, Susan Collins (Maine), Mark Warner (Va.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.V.), Ed Markey (Mass.) and Bob Menendez (N.J.)—would reauthorize NAPA through 2035 and modernize the legislation to reflect strides that have been made to understand the disease, such as including a new focus on promoting healthy aging and reducing risk factors.The Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act—authored by Sens. Moran, Collins, Markey, Capito, Warner and Menendez—would continue through 2035 and set a requirement that the Director of the National Institutes of Health submit an annual budget to Congress estimating the funding necessary for NIH to fully implement NAPA’s research goals. Only two other areas of biomedical research – cancer and HIV/AIDs – have been the subject of special budget development aimed at speeding discovery.“Thanks to the National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA), we’ve made tremendous progress in the fight against Alzheimer’s. The passage of the NAPA Reauthorization Act and the Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act is the next important step to continue the work of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease and ensure that the nation continues to prioritize addressing Alzheimer’s and all other dementia,” said Robert Egge, Alzheimer's Association chief public policy officer and AIM executive director. “On behalf of the Alzheimer’s Association, I would like to extend my deepest thanks to the sponsors for introducing this important bipartisan legislation to help improve the lives of those impacted by Alzheimer’s throughout the country. The Alzheimer’s Association looks forward to working with our tireless advocates and these congressional champions to advance this bipartisan legislation.”# # #"
https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/5/record-high-inflation-requires-real-solutions,"Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them.Record High Inflation Requires Real SolutionsSince President Biden took office, we have seen record high prices for gas, food, rent and utilities. Inflation is wiping out the savings of Kansas families and hurting their ability to meet their most basic needs.President Biden claims his policies “help, not hurt” inflation, however, Wednesday’s news regarding the Consumer Price Index report suggests otherwise. President Biden must change course and focus on real solutions like producing American energy and stopping unchecked government spending.Celebrating All Schools DayIt was great to join folks in McPherson this week for the All Schools Day parade! All Schools Day is an annual event which started in 1914 to celebrate local graduates and has grown into a community-wide, week-long festival. Alumni from near and far come to McPherson in May to continue this century-long tradition. This year, I was able to bring my granddaughter, Paige, to participate in her first parade.Many thanks to Joel Weide from Lindsborg for letting Paige and I, along with Kelsey and her husband Sean, join you on the parade route and to Kyler Jost for helping arrange our participation and for sharing your photos with us. This is an event I enjoy attending whenever I am afforded the opportunity, and I am always grateful to visit with Kansans who travel near and far to be in McPherson on this special day. Congratulations to all the graduates!Conference Committee Meeting on China Competition BillOn Thursday, I gave remarks at the first conference committee meeting on the bipartisan innovation and competition legislation. I spoke about the importance of the U.S. outcompeting adversarial nations, namely China, and how the conference committee can achieve this objective.I emphasized the importance of investing in research and development in places like Kansas. Kansas is one of 26 states that has been identified as annually receiving little federal research funding, with coastal states receiving the vast majority of these dollars. This conference committee has the opportunity to rebalance this disparity, increasing funding to Kansas and ensuring that our intelligence and productivity is properly utilized in our competition for the future. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the conference committee to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to increase our country’s innovation and competitiveness.Western Kansans in WashingtonThis week, the Western Kansas Delegation traveled to Washington, D.C. to meet with federal officials. I enjoyed seeing so many familiar faces around the Capitol from the Great Bend, Hays, Dodge City, Liberal and Garden City areas. On Monday night, I joined the group for an event to discuss the importance of communities in rural Kansas working together to accomplish common goals – and how the Western Kansas Delegation is a prime example of this principle in action. Thank you to Great Bend Area Chamber of Commerce President Megan Barfield for working to organize the trip this year, as well as to Black Hills Energy for hosting everyone.HaysPrior to the event, I was pleased to meet with representatives from Hays and Ellis County. We discussed challenges that many communities in Kansas are facing, and I was pleased to hear about the work happening in Hays to solve issues related to childcare, workforce and infrastructure. In March, SkyWest Airlines announced they intend to end service to 29 Essential Air Service airports, including Hays, Liberal, Dodge City and Salina. I will continue to work with Hays and the Department of Transportation to ensure a positive outcome. Thank you to Mayor Mason Ruder, Vice Mayor Michael Berges, City Commissioner Reese Barrick, City Manager Toby Dougherty, Ellis County Commissioners Neal Younger and Darin Meyers, Chamber President Sarah Wasinger and Grow Hays Executive Director Doug Williams for travelling to our nation’s capital.LiberalI also met with local officials from Liberal to discuss improvements to broadband occurring in Liberal as a result of federal investments, the need for more housing and workforce shortages in the community, the impact of inflation, the importance of rural health care, including recruiting a new VA doctor to Liberal. Thank you to County Commissioner Nathan McCaffrey, Liberal Area Chamber of Commerce Board Chairman Brad Carr and Chamber President Rozelle Webb for your time.Garden CityMembers of the Western Kansas Delegation from Garden City also stopped by the office to provide me with updates and share their priorities with me. I was pleased to learn about the progress of the expansion project at the Garden City Regional Airport, the work they are doing with the Bureau of Reclamation on their water project and the progress of their law enforcement training facility. They also shared challenges with me relating to housing, childcare and workforce, and I appreciate the good work happening in Garden City to resolve these issues. Thank you to City Commissioner Deb Oyler, Assistant City Manager Danielle Burke and Chamber President Myca Bunch for travelling to Washington, D.C. to visit with me.Dodge CityOn Tuesday, I met with Dodge City Commissioners and industry representatives from the community to discuss project updates and the pressing issues facing Western Kansas. Most essential is the development of the Hilmar Cheese Company’s new plant in Dodge City, which will bring a strong economic investment to the area and create approximately 250 high-paying jobs. Additionally, rural housing is a crucial aspect of allowing our rural communities to thrive, and I’m proud to have cosponsored legislation that would incentivize housing development projects while increasing access to affordable homes for low- and middle-income Kansans. We also talked about the importance of Community Block Development Grants, given the significant impact such funding assistance has on local infrastructure, as well as the need for more transparency into the actions of pharmacy benefit managers’ role in prescription drug prices.Honoring Law Enforcement During National Police WeekVery little about being a law enforcement officer can be described as easy. They work around the clock and under difficult circumstances to keep our communities safe and often without the recognition that they deserve. This week, our nation observes National Police Week, a time when we pay tribute to our brave law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty.Over the course of the week, Americans came together to pay tribute to the 619 officers who gave their lives in the line of duty last year. Among them, six brave officers from Kansas were memorialized on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C. I want to express my gratitude for Kansas officers who gave their all protecting the places we call home: Officer Stephen Evans of the Burns Police Department, Captain Clay Germany of the Wichita Police Department, Officer Freddie Castro of the Overland Park Police Department, Officer Theodor James “TJ” Ohlemeier of the Colwich Police Department and Sergeant Stacy Murrow of the Linn County Sheriff’s Office.During this National Police Week and throughout the year, we must remember that law enforcement needs our support and not just during tough times. We must provide them the resources they need to do their jobs and strengthen the bonds of trust with those they serve. As the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Justice, I am committed to making certain our law enforcement officers have the resources and support they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. May God bless our law enforcement officers and protect them from harm as they faithfully perform their duties each and every day.Speaking with Kansans in Washington, D.C.Air Capital STEMThe Wichita area American Rocketry Challenge (TARC) Team stopped by my office while they were in our nation’s capital before competing at TARC nationals in Manassas, Virginia this week. The team was one of 100 teams from 27 states to qualify for nationals this year and the only team representing the Sunflower State. The students of the Wichita-area TARC team represent the future generation of skilled STEM professionals our country so desperately needs to thrive in a global economy. I was glad to wish the Wichita-area TARC team the best of luck at nationals but also express my appreciation for the students’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math, and hear what aspirations they have for the future.Eisenhower GroupI met with the Eisenhower Excellence in Public Service Series, a Kansas group that is a part of the National Excellence in Public Service Series. This organization is dedicated to encouraging, mentoring and preparing women leaders to seek new levels of involvement in government and politics. We had a great discussion on the most pressing issues facing our nation today, including inflation, abortion, immigration and workforce concerns in Kansas. My many thanks to Wendy Bingesser, Benne Hudson, Stephanie James, Jo Kuckelman, Marni Mills, Kim Quade, Becky Reimer, Julie Samaniego, Emily Wellman and Cynthia Yarnell for their leadership in Kansas and for taking time to meet with me this past week.National Teachers Hall of FameI was pleased to meet with the 10 newest inductees to the National Teachers Hall of Fame, located in Emporia, this week while they were being recognized in Washington. These educators were chosen from across the country, and each have over 20 years of teaching experience. The teaching profession is one that carries immense value and importance for society. Our future well-being and prosperity depend on a strong foundational education that sets our young people up for success in life. I thank these teachers for meeting with me and for the passion which they have displayed throughout their careers. I also thank Carol Strickland, Director of the National Teachers Hall of Fame, for her work to honor these educators, along with others in their class. I was pleased to work with Carol on legislation, which was passed into law in 2018, to designate a National Memorial to Fallen Educators at the National Teachers Hall of Fame—Kansas’ first national memorial.Kansas Society of AnesthesiologistsI also spoke with Dr. Mark Brady and Ty Townsend, a veteran and Certified Anesthesiologist Assistant, regarding the National Standards of Practice being developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have spoken to the American Society of Anesthesiologists as well as numerous other groups who share concerns about the VA’s efforts to establish National Standards of Practice for 49 health care occupations. I share concerns the new standards of practice could negatively impact the physician-led, team-based approach to care for our veterans. I appreciated my conversation with Dr. Brady and Ty and will continue encouraging the VA to listen to concerns of VA’s anesthesiologists before approving new practice standards.Questioning Administration OfficialsUSDA Secretary Tom VilsackKansas farmers and ranchers have faced drought and wildfire in recent months, including fires that burned across 13 counties in Kansas last December. Congress approved funding to help with disasters that occurred in 2021, but since this fire occurred outside the “normal grazing period,” these producers are ineligible for certain federal disaster assistance. On Tuesday, I questioned Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on USDA’s recently-announced disaster assistance program, and specifically called on him to provide assistance to those producers affected by wildfires.U.S. ArmyOn Tuesday, I heard testimony from Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth and Chief of Staff of the Army General James McConville on the President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request. They discussed the threats facing the U.S., which includes China as the pacing threat and Russia as a regional threat in Europe. They also discussed the Army’s modernization priorities, which includes robust funding to supply the Army with a wide range of new aircraft, long range precision fires, ground vehicles and missile defense systems. It remains critical to me that the U.S. defense industrial base can support the efforts to equip and field a modern army. My questions to Secretary Wormuth and General McConnville centered on the defense industrial base. Our competition with China and the war in Ukraine has increased the demand for robust and secure supply chains to deliver our servicemembers the tools they need to succeed in any mission. The Secretary and CSA agreed with me on the importance of strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base. I was also pleased that the entire Defense Appropriations Subcommittee agreed to my idea of holding a special, closed hearing to further discuss issues with our industrial base.Commerce Secretary Gina RaimondoOn Wednesday, Secretary Gina Raimondo testified before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Commerce where I had the opportunity to question her on several issues. Last fall, I joined K-State Salina and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as they signed a memorandum of understanding to create an undergraduate program involving the two entities. The new undergraduate program will provide students with the science, technology, engineering and math skills to serve as officers and pilots within the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps. I asked the Secretary of Commerce for an update on the progress of this important program and look forward to seeing it move forward.The other issue I raised was how one small solar company has disrupted a $30 billion industry by using trade inquiries to gain a competitive advantage. Now, good-paying solar jobs in Kansas are at risk due to canceled projects and delayed imports. I questioned Sec. Raimondo about efforts to mitigate the economic impact of this anti-circumvention inquiry.Discussing Global Hunger Needs with World Food Program Director BeasleyOn Wednesday, the Appropriations Subcommittee for State and Foreign Operations held a hearing on global food insecurity. David Beasley, the Executive Director of the World Food Program, testified that nearly 300 million people around the world are “marching towards starvation.” Conflict, the pandemic and drought already created dire circumstances, but Russia’s war against Ukraine has severely worsened the food situation around the globe. I asked Mr. Beasley what can be done to keep countries from instituting protectionist measures to secure their own food supply at a time when the world must come together to supply what it can to those in need, and I also asked about the status of food assistance in Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthis control much of the population. The hearing made clear how dire food security is around the globe, and I appreciated the time to explore solutions.Opposing Abortion ExpansionOn Wednesday, the Senate voted on the most sweeping expansion of abortion access in our nation’s history in a desperate effort to create a federal protection for abortion. This legislation would have permitted unborn children to be terminated at any point for any reason. Additionally, this legislation would have eliminated conscience protections for health care providers who object to terminating human life and abolished state laws, such as waiting periods or requiring parental consent for minors to obtain an abortion. Not only is this legislation immoral, it is far outside the mainstream of American opinion and would have placed the United States alongside China and North Korea as outliers with the world’s most permissive abortion laws.Meeting with U.S. Military LeadershipAhead of next week’s Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hearing, I hosted U.S. military leadership who will testify regarding the President’s Budget Request for FY2023. I met with General Jay Raymond, Chief of Space Operations for Space Force, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Brown Jr., and I appreciated the opportunity to speak with these individuals prior to their hearings.Secretary Kendall and General Brown outlined their priorities for the Air Force heading into a new fiscal year, namely, calling for greater investments in defending our air bases around the world, advancing operational space capabilities and bolstering our electronic warfare defenses. Kansas is home to McConnell Air Force Base – where I hosted Secretary Kendall in April – and Forbes Field, so it is my priority to ensure he understands these entities must be properly fitted with the aircraft necessary to rapidly deploy when our national security is at risk. I look forward to discussing these details at greater length when they both when they testify before the Defense Subcommittee.I also discussed the appropriations priorities for the U.S. Space Force with General Raymond, as well as the role Kansas plays in our space defense. We also touched on the importance of building a robust satellite network in space to improve our missile tracking and warning capabilities as our adversaries like China and Russia continue to advance their technology and capabilities in space. The next space race is happening now, and it’s important for our national security that the U.S. remains competitive. As co-chair of the Senate Space Force Caucus, I appreciated hearing General Raymond’s perspective on how to continue developing the Space Force to maintain America’s leadership role in space, and I look forward to hearing more of his thoughts in front of the subcommittee.Oversight on Quality of Care for VeteransThis week as the lead Republican on the Senate VA Committee, we held a hearing to examine the quality of care in VA and the private sector. I am concerned by a recent Inspector General report detailing examples of patient safety breakdowns and poor leadership culture. The VA has also failed to fully implement the MISSION Act’s quality standards directive. Our nation’s veterans deserve world class treatment when utilizing the VA for care, and it has been and will continue to be a top priority of mine to work with my colleagues to make certain that the VA system works for veterans and puts them first, not the other way around. Click here or below to watch my questioning.Working to Reduce Red Tape for New BusinessesThis week, I introduced the Supporting NEW BUSINESSES Act, legislation to make it easier to start and grow a new business, with Senator Cortez-Masto. This bipartisan bill will require the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide annual awards that would encourage states and localities to reduce red tape and streamline the process for starting a new business. Celebrating cities and states that implement innovative solutions to cut red tape, reduce bureaucracy, and make it easier for entrepreneurs to build successful businesses will encourage communities to enact policies that promote economic growth. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to promote the creation and success of small businesses.Vulcan Rocket Update from ULAThis week I met with Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance (ULA). He provided me with updates on the status of the Vulcan rocket, which is to be used primarily for the U.S. Government’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. As our adversaries, especially China, continue to advance their defense capabilities in the space domain, programs like the NSSL aim to keep America safe and competitive from interplanetary threats. When I welcomed Mr. Bruno and his team to Wichita, he quickly recognized the role that our state can play in this sector, and I will continue to leverage our capabilities so that Kansas is understood to be a catalyst for space manufacturing and development. Welcoming Rudy Klopfer and Family to the CapitolOn Wednesday, I met Rudy Klopfer, his wife Lori and his children Spencer and Spencer and Mallori, in the Capitol Rotunda to welcome them to Washington. My staff and I regularly work with Rudy as the CEO of VA Eastern Kansas Health Care System. His role is important in making certain Kansas veterans are receiving quality health care, and he often welcomes me to tour VA facilities in Kansas. I appreciated the opportunity to offer him a tour of the U.S. Capitol.Fort Riley Change of CommandOn Wednesday, the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley held a Change of Command Ceremony. While I was unable to attend due to Senate business in Washington, D.C. I was pleased a member of my staff could be present. I value the important relationship I have with Fort Riley and look forward to working with the new Commanding General, Major General John V. Meyers III. Thank you to Commanding General Major General Douglas A. Sims II for his leadership at Fort Riley, and I wish him the best as he takes on his new role with the Joint Staff.Welcoming Kansas Honor Flight VeteransIt’s always special to have the opportunity to welcome Kansas Honor Flight veterans to the memorials built in their honor. For many, it is their first time seeing the memorials. Tuesday morning, I expressed my gratitude to each of them for their service and sacrifice.These Kansas veterans came from across our state, and I enjoyed hearing about their experience in our nation’s capital. It was also great to speak with WWII and Korean War veteran Max Manning from Topeka. Shortly after leaving the service, he became a minister and has preached for nearly 70 years, serving in his own community and around the world through ministry. Thank you to the Honor Flight team and volunteers who make these trips possible.Happy Hospital WeekLast week we celebrated National Hospital Week as we thank our Kansas health care professionals who serve their communities day in and day out. From urban health systems to rural critical access hospitals, I have witnessed the dedication of Kansas health care workers. Their work is often taken for granted, especially in the midst of a public health emergency, but we thank them for their willingness to serve and the steadfast compassion shown to patients.Note: Fields marked with an * are required."
