https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-johnson-joins-sen-tuberville-colleagues-in-calling-on-leader-schumer-to-safeguard-national-security-by-voting-on-ndaa,"WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and 22 of their Republican colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) demanding the Senate vote on the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) before the end of September. The U.S. House of Representatives approved its version of the legislation in July, with a broad, bipartisan majority voting in support. The letter calls on Schumer to schedule a vote on the NDAA in time for an open Senate amendment process to take place. Among other priorities, the legislation funds military technology, strengthens capabilities and delivers a 4.6 percent pay raise to America’s service members.“At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, ‘When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well.’ Two centuries later, that still rings true. Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight,” the senators wrote.“Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 – 101. For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process. As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period,” the senators concluded.Sens. Johnson and Tuberville were joined on the letter by Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and John Hoeven (R-N.D.).The full text of the letter can be found here and below.September 13, 2022 The Honorable Charles E.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-johnson-grills-big-tech-execs-on-censorship-at-senate-hearing,"WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), questioned former and current executives from Twitter, Meta, YouTube and TikTok during a hearing entitled, “Social Media’s Impact on Homeland Security.”Sen. Johnson pressed the witnesses on censorship of him and proceedings of the Committee, the silencing of conservative voices, the influence of misinformation surrounding elections, internal political bias at social media companies and their role in removing “COVID-19 disinformation.” Sen. Johnson’s questioning can be found here, here and here. Excerpts are below.On social media election influenceSen. Johnson: “Twitter was actually very effective, when they blocked the New York Post articles on the Hunter Biden laptop. We had Jack Dorsey in front of the Commerce Committee back in, I think, October 2020. And both Senator Cruz and myself asked him, because we were talking about, you know, Russians using the platforms to impact our elections, and everybody agrees that could happen. We asked Mr. Dorsey, do you believe Twitter could impact the election? Mr. Dorsey said, ‘No.’ Mr. Roetter, do you believe Twitter has the capability of impacting the election?”  Former Twitter VP: “I think all these social platforms are they're so massive, it's hard to believe that they're not impacting.” Sen. Johnson: “Mr. Boland, do you believe that as well?” Former Facebook VP: “These platforms absolutely have influence and I believe-- ”Sen. Johnson: “Mr. Cain?”  Lincoln Network Senior Fellow: “Absolutely.”  Sen. Johnson: “Okay. So there is a problem right there. Okay. And I appreciate you acknowledging that fact.”On the disinformation campaignSen. Johnson: “I want to talk about a little bit about the other disinformation coming out of this committee. The day or two after Senator Grassley and I issued our report based on U.S. documents, interviews with U.S. persons, our now committee chairman, who was then committee ranking member, issued a press release, said Peters, Wyden response to Republican effort to amplify Russian disinformation. You said, I generated a partisan political report that is rooted in Russian disinformation. Mr. Chairman, do you want to retract that false allegation now? Now that we know that the Hunter Biden laptop is accurate, that there has not been one scintilla of information provided in Senator Grassley's and my report that has ever been refuted. It was 100% accurate. And yet you, as ranking member of the committee, accused me repeatedly of soliciting and disseminating Russian disinformation. Do you want to retract your false allegation here that you issued in your press release on September 23rd?”Sen. Peters: “No. Let's just focus on what we're trying to do.”Sen. Johnson: “Well, I'm focusing on this because this is exactly the type of harm we can do to our political process. When you have these big tech companies engaging in political debate, censoring one side of the political spectrum and amplifying the false allegations of another side.”On censoring COVID-19 informationSen. Johnson: “So obviously, this was published and they were publishing other similar information during that time period when President Biden lied to the American public that this was a pandemic of the unvaxxed. And if you got vaccinated, you're not going to go to the hospital, you're not going to be in an ICU unit and you're not going to die. Well, 63.5% of the people fully vaccinated were dying in England at the exact same time. Why didn't you pull this? Have you ever labeled the President of the United States comment as ‘misinformation?’ Have you ever done that? Any of you? I'll take that as a no.“Again, I just wonder, who are the authorities? Who do you think you are to censor information from eminently qualified doctors who had the courage and compassion to treat COVID patients when the NIH guideline was basically, if you test positive for COVID, go home. Be afraid. Isolate yourself. Don't do anything until you're so sick, we'll send you to the hospital. We'll give you Remdesivir, where we have 1,600 deaths so far. We’ll put you on a ventilator and we’ll watch you die. You guys bear a fair amount of responsibility for hundreds of thousands of people not being treated, and I would say probably dying that didn't have to die. I hope you're proud of yourselves.”###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, and 37 of their Republican colleagues in introducing the Simplify Timelines and Assure Regulatory Transparency (START) Act. This legislation codifies improvements to the environmental review process and definition of navigable waters, reduces timelines for Endangered Species Act consultations and prohibits adoption of President Biden’s social cost of carbon.In an effort to accelerate energy projects and cut costs, Sen. Johnson voted in favor of a similar amendment to the Democrats’ multi-billion dollar Inflation Reduction Act in August. Previously, Sen. Johnson joined his colleagues in an amicus brief opposing the EPA’s proposed expansion of the waters of the United States (WOTUS), which would burden Wisconsin farmers.Sens. Johnson and Capito are joined on the legislation by Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).The full text of the bill can be found here.###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/9/sen-johnson-to-cdc-director-walensky-you-have-failed-to-provide-data-on-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-events,"WASHINGTON – On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a follow-up letter to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), regarding her “inadequate and unacceptable” response about CDC’s surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.Sen. Johnson had previously sent letters to CDC on June 23, 2022 and July 25, 2022, seeking clarity about whether the agency is sufficiently monitoring COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.  In June 2022, CDC provided an incomplete response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that lacked the data CDC initially claimed it would generate to monitor these adverse events.  Specifically, CDC told the FOIA requester that the agency did not conduct a Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis, which was meant to identify vaccine adverse events. Then, Dr. John Su, a CDC official on the agency’s Vaccine Safety Team, said the opposite to a media outlet claiming that the “CDC has been performing PRRs since Feb 2021, and continues to do so to date.” The senator wrote to Dir. Walensky, “You have failed to explain why the CDC made inconsistent statements about the data it generates to track these adverse events.  Moreover, even though I clearly asked CDC to provide the data that it supposedly generated to track vaccine adverse events, you failed to do so.”“Although your response did include an addendum containing weekly data tables CDC produced from February 26, 2021 to September 30, 2021, your overall lack of transparency is unacceptable particularly in light of CDC’s inconsistent statements on this matter,” the senator added.The full text of the letter can be found here and below. September 12, 2022Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPHDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Dear Director Walensky:               I write to you regarding your inadequate and unacceptable response to my letters about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.  You have failed to explain why the CDC made inconsistent statements about the data it generates to track these adverse events.  Moreover, even though I clearly asked CDC to provide the data that it supposedly generated to track vaccine adverse events, you failed to do so. This data should be made public immediately to better inform the American people about risks of specific adverse events relating to the COVID-19 vaccines.  Your lack of clarity calls into question whether CDC has and continues to sufficiently monitor COVID-19 vaccine adverse events. On June 23, 2022, I requested that you provide data on CDC’s surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events that the agency claimed it would compile in its Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document dated January 29, 2021.[1]  The data that I requested included CDC’s Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analyses that, according to the SOP, is meant “to identify [adverse events] that are disproportionately reported relative to other [adverse events].”[2] My June 23 letter was based on CDC’s reported failure to produce this data in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.[3]  Specifically, the SOP stated that, “CDC will perform PRR data mining on a weekly basis or as needed.”[4]  However, in response to a May 9, 2022 FOIA request for these records, CDC wrote, “no PRRs were conducted” and that “data mining is outside of th [sic] agency’s purview.”[5]On July 25, 2022, I sent you a follow up letter on this topic after a CDC official reportedly contradicted your agency’s previous assertion.[6]  Although CDC claimed that “no PRRs were conducted,” Dr. John Su, a CDC official that works on the Vaccine Safety Team, reportedly told a media outlet that “CDC has been performing PRRs since Feb 2021, and continues to do so to date.”[7]In addition to reiterating my requests from the June 23 letter, I also asked for the following information:[8]              On September 6, 2022, over two months after I sent my initial letter on this matter, the CDC provided your response.[9]  In that letter you confirmed that, “CDC performed PRR analysis between March 25, 2022, through July 31, 2022[.]”[10]  However, despite my July 25 request for all of the PRRs performed since February 2021, you failed to provide any of this information.[11]  You also noted that, “PRRs were not run between February 26, 2021, to September 30, 2021.”[12]  However, your response lacked any justification for why CDC performed PRRs during certain periods and not others.  You also provided no explanation as to why Dr. Su’s assertion that, “CDC has been performing PRRs since Feb 2021, and continues to do so to date,” completely contradicts the CDC’s response to a FOIA request as well as your September 6, 2022 response to me.[13]In addition, you claimed that, “CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chose to rely on Empirical Bayesian (EB) data mining—a more robust technique used to analyze disproportionate reporting—rather than PRR calculations to mitigate potential false signals.”[14]  You also noted that CDC and FDA plan to continue to use EB data mining moving forward.[15]  Yet, despite my June 23 request for Bayesian data mining described in 2.3.2 of the January 2021 SOP, you failed to provide this information as well.[16]In your response, you claimed that, “results from PRR analysis were generally consistent with EB data mining.”[17]  However, because of your failure to provide these analyses to Congress and to the American people, the public cannot verify your assertion.  Although your response did include an addendum containing weekly data tables CDC produced from February 26, 2021 to September 30, 2021, your overall lack of transparency is unacceptable particularly in light of CDC’s inconsistent statements on this matter.[18] If CDC is truly conducting proper analyses of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events, it should not take you over two months to provide this information.  Accordingly, I ask that you provide complete responses to my June 23 and July 25 letters (enclosed) and the questions below by no later than September 19, 2022. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###[1] Letter from Senator Ron Johnson, to Rochelle Walensky,

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and 20 of their Republican colleagues in introducing Congressional Review Act (CRA) legislation to nullify new rules proposed by the Biden administration which would add burdensome requirements to charter schools seeking funding.Earlier this year, the Department of Education overhauled the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP). The Biden administration’s new changes would place federal, one-size-fits-all requirements on charter schools, making it difficult — if not impossible — for many high-quality public schools to receive funding. Despite substantial bipartisan backlash, the administration is moving ahead with its plans, which will strip families of education choice and give more power to bureaucrats in D.C.Sen. Johnson has been a key advocate for charter schools and educational choice for families. In April, Sen. Johnson joined his colleagues in urging the Department of Education to reconsider their proposed rules redefining the Charter Schools Program (CSP). In May, Sen. Johnson joined a bipartisan resolution celebrating National Charter Schools Week and commending charter schools on their contribution to education.Sens.

In February 2022, we issued Report No. DODIG-2022-065, “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan,” that detailed the extent to which the DoD managed and tracked displaced persons from Afghanistan through the biometric enrollment, screening, and vetting process. In addition, we have an ongoing evaluation on security and life support practices for Afghan evacuees at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.For the remainder of the questions in your letter, we determined that the OIGs for the respective agencies with jurisdiction over those matters, copied on my response, are better suited to respond.We appreciate your interest in our work and we will keep you informed about the progress about our current and future work.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/9/a-dark-moment-for-america,"It is clear that Joe Biden wants to fundamentally transform this country. My question is do you love, much less like, something you want to fundamentally change? I don't wake up and say to my wife, ""Jane, I love you, but now I want to change everything about you.""President Biden's unprecedented move to forgive student loan debt is grossly unfair to families who didn't send their kids to college or managed to pay off their student debt.70% of the $300 billion inflationary spending will go to people in the top 60% of earners. Democrats have become the party of the elite.The crisis at the southern border has lead to an unprecedented flood of illegal immigrants and the deadly effects of unregulated fentanyl have lead several Wisconsin counties to declare fentanyl a public health crisis.Democrats are as detached from economic reality as they are from the truth. The Orwellian named ""Inflation Reduction Act"" will do no such thing. It will worsen inflation, supercharge the IRS (adding 87,000 IRS agents!) to go after American families and likely drive the cost of energy up rather than down.It's crystal clear - President Biden was lying through his teeth to the American people about Hunter Biden's corrupt business dealings. Whistleblowers revealed the partisan FBI's scheme to downplay derogatory information about Hunter Biden and end my investigation. This corruption needs to be exposed.In August, I hosted a roundtable on the crisis at the southern border to discuss the unprecedented flood of illegal immigrants, the deadly effects of unregulated fentanyl and the Biden administration's failure to secure the border. I was joined by the former Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, President of the National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd, Founder of Saving Others For Archie Lauri Badura, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, Washington County Sheriff Martin Schulteis and Fond du Lac County Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt.What I've seen at the border is profoundly disturbing. You have to go down to the border to really experience what I think every American needs to understand.Sheriff Mark Podoll said, "" Wisconsin is a border state. We are getting everything that comes through that open border. And if people don't believe that, they need to pull their head out of the sand because it's happening here.""Read more in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Watch the entire panel discussion on Wisconsin Eye.My office along with Sen. Chuck Grassley are seeking records relating to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) and FBI's contact with Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies relating to the Biden family, Hunter Biden's laptop and Russian disinformation around the time of the election.The letter reads ""the FBI's consistent efforts to falsely paint information relating to Biden Family misconduct as Russian disinformation continues to draw serious concerns, and those concerns are magnified by the FBI's consistent failure to answer congressional inquiries.""The more we learn, the more questions arise. We need whistleblowers to come forward to expose the truth, hold people accountable and restore integrity and credibility to the FBI and federal agencies. We need to get to the bottom of this corruption.Watch Mark Zuckerberg's comments here.What a thrill for Milwaukee to host the national American Legion convention August 26 - September 1. Wisconsin loves veterans and I was honored to address the convention attendees. Your service and sacrifice makes you the finest among us.During the month of August, I held numerous town halls around the state. I always appreciate the opportunity to hear what is on the mind of Wisconsinites. There is a lot of concern over 40-year-high inflation.I hit a milestone with my 100th telephone town hall on August 31. Thank you to everyone who joins these calls which allow for in-depth discussions.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sens-johnson-grassley-seek-answers-from-fbi-doj-facebook-about-suppression-of-hunter-biden-reports-after-fbi-warning,"OSHKOSH – On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, pushed for clarity about comments made by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg indicating that Facebook took “meaningful” steps to decrease distribution of the reports about Hunter Biden’s laptop in 2020 after Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials approached the company with warnings about disinformation. Sens. Johnson and Grassley are seeking records relating to the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) and FBI’s contact with Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies relating to the Biden family, Hunter Biden’s laptop and Russian disinformation around the time of the election. They also ask for the names of government and Facebook officials involved in these conversations.   “The FBI’s consistent efforts to falsely paint information relating to Biden Family misconduct as Russian disinformation continues to draw serious concerns, and those concerns are magnified by the FBI’s consistent failure to answer congressional inquiries,” the senators wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray. “The FBI’s ill-conceived actions not only interfered in our congressional investigation by frustrating and obstructing our ability to advance the matters under review, it also interfered in the 2020 election.”The senators wrote separately to Zuckerberg seeking relevant records and the names of officials involved in the communications with the Justice Department and FBI. They also ask for clarity about the dates when Facebook decreased the distribution of articles relating to Hunter Biden’s laptop. “The American people deserve to know whether the FBI used Facebook as part of their alleged plan to discredit information about Hunter Biden,” the senators wrote to Zuckerberg. Read more about the senators’ letters in the New York Post.The full text of the senators’ letter to Zuckerberg can be found here.The full text of the senators’ letter to the FBI and Justice Department can be found here. Over the last two years, Sens. Johnson and Grassley have led the investigation into Hunter Biden’s foreign financial entanglements. In August 2020, the FBI provided an unnecessary briefing to the senators, which led to a leak that falsely labeled the investigation as advancing Russian disinformation. The senators are demanding FBI personnel appear for transcribed interviews about this interference after years of evading questions. Read the senators’ September 2020 report here?and November 2020 supplemental report here. The senators also publicly released bank records relating to the Biden family’s financial connections to the communist Chinese government on March 28, 2022; March 29, 2022; and April 5, 2022. ###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sens-johnson-grassley-call-on-fbi-to-explain-interference-in-hunter-biden-investigation,"Request FBI Personnel Appear for Transcribed InterviewOSHKOSH – On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Bradley Benavides and FBI Intelligence Analyst in Charge of the Washington Field Office Intelligence Division Nikki Floris requesting their appearance for a transcribed interview to explain the FBI’s interference in the senators’ Hunter Biden investigation.On August 6, 2020, Ms. Floris and Mr. Benavides provided Sens. Johnson and Grassley with an unnecessary briefing on behalf of the FBI and Intelligence Community on matters purportedly related to the senators’ investigation into Hunter Biden. The briefing led to a leak that falsely labeled the investigation as advancing Russian disinformation.The senators wrote, “FBI officials initiated a scheme to downplay derogatory information on Hunter Biden for the purpose of shutting down investigative activity relating to his potential criminal exposure by labeling it ‘disinformation’” and “whistleblowers have also alleged that local FBI leadership instructed employees not to look at the Hunter Biden laptop immediately after the FBI had obtained it.”Sens. Johnson and Grassley have previously requested additional records related to the briefing, but have not received a sufficient response from FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The FBI has consistently failed to respond in full to each request and failed to provide those critical records which casts further doubt on the true purpose for the briefing,” said the senators.Read the senators’ September 2020 report here and November 2020 supplemental report here.Read more about the letter in Fox News and Washington Examiner.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.August 25, 2022Ms. Nikki FlorisIntelligence Analyst in ChargeIntelligence Division, Washington Field OfficeFederal Bureau of Investigation Mr. Bradley BenavidesDeputy Assistant DirectorCounterintelligence DivisionFederal Bureau of Investigation                                                                                 Dear Ms. Floris and Mr. Benavides:On August 6, 2020, as we were finishing our September 23, 2020, report on Hunter Biden’s financial connections to foreign governments and questionable foreign nationals, you provided a briefing to us on behalf of the FBI and Intelligence Community.[1]  As we have publicly and privately stated to you and Director Wray since that briefing, the briefing was unnecessary and was only done because of pressure from our Democratic colleagues, including Democratic Leadership, to falsely attack our Biden investigation as advancing Russian disinformation.[2] For example, on July 13, 2020, then-Minority Leader Schumer, Senator Warner, Speaker Pelosi and Representative Schiff sent a letter, with a classified attachment, to the FBI to express a purported belief that Congress was the subject of a foreign disinformation campaign.[3]  The classified attachment included unclassified elements that, among other things, attempted – and failed – to tie our investigation into the Biden family’s financial deals to foreign disinformation.  Those elements were then leaked to the press.[4]  As you are undoubtedly aware, we’ve successfully refuted those false allegations and, most recently, we’ve made public a series of authentic bank records relating to the Biden family’s connections to the communist Chinese government, which Democrats had previously tried – and failed – to claim advanced Russian disinformation.[5] In addition, on July 16, 2020, then-Ranking Member Peters and then-Ranking Member Wyden wrote to us requesting a briefing from the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force on matters purportedly relating to our investigation.[6]  On July 28, 2020, we responded to them and reminded them that in March 2020, the FBI and relevant members of the Intelligence Community had already briefed our committees and provided assurances that there was no reason that our committees should not continue their investigation.[7]  Nonetheless, the FBI succumbed to the Democratic pressure and provided the infamous August 6, 2020, briefing. With respect to the substance of the briefing, it consisted primarily of information that we already knew and information unconnected to our Biden investigation.  We made clear to you at the briefing that it was not relevant to the substance of our work.  In response, you stated that the FBI is not attempting to “quash, curtail, or interfere” in the investigation in any way.[8]  We also made clear our concern that the briefing would be subject to a leak that would shed a false light on the focus of our investigation.  Indeed, on May 1, 2021, the Washington Post did exactly that and so did the other inaccurate media articles during the course of our investigation which falsely labeled our investigation as advancing Russian disinformation.[9]  Moreover, whistleblowers have recently alleged that in August 2020, the same month you provided the briefing to us, FBI officials initiated a scheme to downplay derogatory information on Hunter Biden for the purpose of shutting down investigative activity relating to his potential criminal exposure by labeling it “disinformation.”[10]  Whistleblowers have also alleged that local FBI leadership instructed employees not to look at the Hunter Biden laptop immediately after the FBI had obtained it.[11]At the briefing as well as after, we requested relevant records relating to what happened at the briefing, including the 302 or similar summary, the intelligence basis for the briefing and the personnel involved in making the decision to brief us.  On August 12, 2020; May 3, 2021; July 25, 2022; and August 11, 2022, those requests were made.[12]  The FBI has consistently failed to respond in full to each request and failed to provide those critical records which casts further doubt on the true purpose for the briefing.Simply put, the unnecessary FBI briefing provided the Democrats and liberal media the vehicle to spread their false narrative that our work advanced Russian disinformation.  Although you stated that the FBI didn’t intend to “interfere” in our investigation, the practical effect of such an unnecessary briefing and the subsequent leaks relating to it created interference, which frustrated and obstructed congressional oversight efforts. The FBI answers to Congress and the American people; therefore, we request that you appear before us for a transcribed interview on these and related matters no later than September 8, 2022.  In addition, at the time of our initial request in August 2020, all records relating to the briefing should have been preserved.[13]  This letter reiterates that request.Sincerely,###[1] Chairman Charles Grassley, S.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent a letter to Department of Justice Inspector General (DOJ IG) Michael Horowitz revealing new whistleblower allegations relating to the FBI’s handling of Hunter Biden’s laptop.The senator wrote, “Recently, my office heard from individuals with knowledge of the FBI’s apparent corruption.  After the FBI obtained the Hunter Biden laptop from the Wilmington, DE computer shop, these whistleblowers stated that local FBI leadership told employees, ‘you will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop’ and that the FBI is ‘not going to change the outcome of the election again.’”The senator called on the DOJ IG to “take immediate steps to investigate the FBI’s actions regarding the laptop.”  Sen. Johnson wrote, “I hope you understand that the longer your office stands on the sidelines and delays investigating the FBI’s actions, the harder it will be for you to uncover the truth and hold individuals accountable for wrongdoing.”In October 2020, the senator led the call for the DOJ IG to investigate the FBI’s handling of Hunter Biden’s laptop, but Inspector General Horowitz declined, citing an ongoing U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation.Read more about the letter in the Washington Examiner.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.August 23, 2022The Honorable Michael E. HorowitzInspector GeneralDepartment of Justice950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.Washington, DC 20530 Dear Inspector General Horowitz:              Whistleblowers have recently contacted my office to share serious concerns about the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) handling of Hunter Biden’s laptop.  These new allegations provide even more evidence of FBI corruption and renew calls for you to take immediate steps to investigate the FBI’s actions regarding the laptop.In October 2020, I called on the FBI to explain what actions it took after receiving the laptop.[1]  The FBI failed to respond to my questions and I led the call for you to examine whether the FBI took appropriate and necessary investigative steps after receiving Hunter Biden’s laptop.[2]  Four months later, in February 2021, you informed me that your office would not take any actions that could interfere with an ongoing investigation.  You wrote:[I]n December 2020, Hunter Biden publicly stated that the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) in Delaware advised his legal counsel that the USAO was investigating his tax affairs. Earlier this month, the Department announced that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware was one of two U.S. Attorneys asked to remain in his role in the new administration. In light of these circumstances, and consistent with the OIG’s practice, we will not take actions that could interfere with an ongoing investigation.[3]Since then, whistleblowers have come forward to Congress alleging that FBI officials intentionally undermined efforts to investigate Hunter Biden.[4]  Recently, my office heard from individuals with knowledge of the FBI’s apparent corruption.  After the FBI obtained the Hunter Biden laptop from the Wilmington, DE computer shop, these whistleblowers stated that local FBI leadership told employees, “you will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop” and that the FBI is “not going to change the outcome of the election again.”  Further, these whistleblowers allege that the FBI did not begin to examine the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election—potentially a year after the FBI obtained the laptop in December 2019.[5]  While I understand your hesitation to investigate a matter that may be related to an ongoing investigation, it is clear to me based on numerous credible whistleblower disclosures that the FBI cannot be trusted with the handling of Hunter Biden’s laptop.  I hope you understand that the longer your office stands on the sidelines and delays investigating the FBI’s actions, the harder it will be for you to uncover the truth and hold individuals accountable for wrongdoing.  I call on you to immediately investigate the FBI’s handling of Hunter Biden’s laptop and begin by obtaining the history of the investigative actions taken by the FBI on Hunter Biden’s laptop which should be available on the FBI’s case management system, Sentinel.  This case file should provide valuable information about the steps the FBI took to examine the laptop.              The American people deserve transparency and expect allegations of government corruption to be fully and immediately investigated.  Thank you for your attention to this important request.  Sincerely,###[1] Letter from Ron Johnson, Chairman, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, to Christopher A.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-recognizes-wisconsin-mother-advocating-for-fentanyl-overdose-awareness-securing-southern-border,"OSHKOSH – Last week, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led a roundtable on the crisis at our southern border to discuss the negative impacts of open border policies and bring awareness to the deadly effects of the unregulated fentanyl. Roundtable panelist Lauri Badura, mother of a fentanyl victim and founder of Saving Others For Archie, spoke extensively about her advocacy for national action in the opioid epidemic. On Sunday, Lauri appeared on Fox and Friends Weekend to bring awareness to the fentanyl crisis and urge the Biden administration to take action to prevent the flood of fentanyl through our southern border.“I'm pleading with our administration to do something. We have to do something about this border. It's flooding. It's killing our families. We're losing our nation of young adults,” said Lauri Badura.In an effort to combat the growing fentanyl crisis, Sen. Ron Johnson introduced the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues (SOFA) Act in 2017, 2019 and 2021 to give law enforcement enhanced tools to combat the opioid epidemic and close a loophole in current law that makes it difficult to prosecute crimes involving some synthetic opioids. The Trump Administration enacted SOFA through regulation in 2018, and Congress has extended the regulation multiple times since then. The current regulation is set to expire at the end of 2022.  Sen. Johnson continues to call on his colleagues in Congress to pass the SOFA Act to put these changes into law.   Lauri’s full segment on Fox & Friends can be found here. Highlights are below.On losing her son to fentanyl“No mother wants to wake up and have to find the news that their child has been taken. This is something that is taking over America. This is the biggest crisis, I think, that we've ever faced as a nation. My son was 19 years old, and it was 2014. So this is really when fentanyl wasn't even talked about. It was a substance that was laced, and he had no idea that he was not going to wake up and that he was going to die. Archie was beautiful – blue eyes, kind-hearted and full of life. And our family is devastated. My husband Andy and my son Augie, we go every single day with our hearts broken, and we refuse to not tell others across America. My plea today is not just to parents. It is to the public. This is something that we need to do as a country. We need to. We have so much the DEA is bringing in – all of these drugs that they're stopping. But what about the drugs that they're not stopping? That's getting into all of our family members, and it could be your nephew, your cousin.On advocating for fentanyl overdose awareness“I tell you, I started this billboard campaign. It's in Times Square. I did it with Song for Charlie and Love, Logan – two other parents that lost their children along with 16 other faces. Just because of this day, it's in Manhattan. I'm asking people to please go and look at that billboard on the corner of Broadway and W 43rd St., and please, look up. I asked the mayor. I asked HHS. I didn't hear from anybody in New York, but we have to work together as a nation. And I'm pleading with our administration to do something. We have to do something about this border. It's flooding. It's killing our family. We're losing our nation of young adults.”###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Lloyd Austin, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky regarding concerns about mislabeling and unauthorized manufacturing connected to COVID-19 vaccines at military bases.Nine DoD whistleblowers disclosed to Congress that at least one vaccine lot number—FW1331—was manufactured at a location that was not FDA approved. These whistleblowers also alleged that this lot number, which was printed on a vaccine vial labeled “Comirnaty,” appeared on a CDC database that lists Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) vaccine lot numbers.The senator wrote, “DoD, FDA, and CDC must provide a thorough explanation for why a vaccine lot with the ‘Comirnaty’ label would be listed on a database that is meant to display vaccine lots associated with the EUA.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below.August 18, 2022The Honorable Lloyd J.

Chad Coppin, who is a commissioned officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, disclosed that on June 10, 2022, his base located in Juneau, Alaska received “a shipment of 60 Comirnaty vials packaged in six boxes of ten vials.”[2]  These vials included the vaccine lot number FW1331.[3]  Lt. Coppin noted that, “[p]rior to this date, only emergency use authorization shots [had] been available[.]”[4]  Lt.

Coppin reported that he attempted to determine the shipping and manufacturing locations of these specific vaccines.[5]  He explained to my office that the medical staff at his base informed him that the vials were shipped from Ft. Detrick in Maryland.[6]  Lt. Coppin stated that he contacted Ft. Detrick to ask about the manufacturing location of the vials and was told that these vials came from a “Pfizer plant” located in Kalamazoo, Michigan.[7] Lt. Coppin then called Pfizer directly to ask about the manufacturing location of the specific vaccine lot number for these vials: FW1331.[8]  A Pfizer customer service representative apparently told him that this lot was manufactured in France on January 28, 2022 and expires on December 31, 2022.[9]  Lt. Coppin disclosed to my office that, “The significance of the France manufacturing location is that it is not an authorized manufacturing location as per the FDA’s Comirnaty [Biologics License Application (BLA)] Supplement Approval letter dated December 16, 2021.”[10]  That letter approved a “30 microgram dose formulation (Tris/Sucrose) of Comirnaty” to be manufactured at the “Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV, Purrs, Belgium facility.”[11]  Any Comirnaty vaccine lots that are manufactured outside of the FDA-approved manufacturing locations and distributed to U.S citizens raises significant legal and health-related concerns.In addition to the lack of clarity relating to the manufacturing location of vaccine lot FW1331, another DoD whistleblower raised questions about whether this specific vaccine lot is mislabeled as “Comirnaty.”  1Lt. Mark Bashaw, who is a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army, found that the lot number contained on these “Comirnaty” vials—FW1331—matched a lot number on a CDC database listing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) vaccine lots.[12]              According to CDC, this database, which is called the COVID-19 Vaccine Lot Number and Expiration Date Report, “contain[s] all lots for COVID-19 vaccines made available under [EUA] for distribution in the United States.”[13]  1Lt. Bashaw disclosed to my office that he downloaded this database and found that it included vaccine lot FW1331.[14]  DoD, FDA, and CDC must provide a thorough explanation for why a vaccine lot with the “Comirnaty” label would be listed on a database that is meant to display vaccine lots associated with the EUA.               Lt. Coppin, 1Lt. Bashaw, and the additional seven DoD whistleblowers who brought this information to my attention have exercised their right to talk to Congress.  Any retaliatory actions taken against these individuals will not be tolerated and will be investigated immediately.  DoD, FDA, and CDC owe our service members complete transparency regarding the COVID-19 vaccines that the Biden administration has forced upon them.  With this in mind, I request that you provide the following information:Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than September 1, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,[1] Letter from nine Dep’t of Defense whistleblowers, Aug. 15, 2022 (enclosed).[2] Chad Coppin disclosure to Sen.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-hears-from-experts-and-local-law-enforcement-on-disastrous-effects-of-biden-border-crisis,"MILWAUKEE – On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, hosted a roundtable on the crisis at the southern border to discuss the unprecedented flood of illegal immigrants, the deadly effects of unregulated fentanyl and the Biden administration’s failure to secure the border. Sen. Johnson was joined by the former Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, President of the National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd, Founder of Saving Others For Archie Lauri Badura, Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll, Washington County Sheriff Martin Schulteis and Fond du Lac County Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt.Watch the full roundtable here. Highlights can be found below.Sen. Johnson on the disturbing realities of Biden’s border crisis“You have to go down to the border to really experience what I think every American really needs to understand. It's profoundly disturbing. Last time I was down there, we immediately went on a night-time patrol with Brandon [Judd] and other border patrol agents. And we immediately encountered a small group, and we came across a number of children. There was little six and a little seven-year old girl – they were unaccompanied minors. First thing you notice is they just have this little baggie, had a birth certificate and a card, a notecard, with a phone number and an address – no identification. If those unaccompanied children had lost that, they'd have been completely lost. Fortunately for those two little girls, they were put together with another group that didn't abuse them. We had Bill Melugin from Fox News with our group, and he relayed to us that – I don't know how much earlier weeks or whatever – it was the exact same spot two little girls about the same age, were being treated for being brutally raped from their human traffickers. So those are the realities that are being overlooked, those are the realities that are being ignored, those are the realities that are being caused by this open-border policy of this administration.”Sheriff Mark Podoll on the impact of Biden’s border crisis on Wisconsin“Wisconsin is a border state. We are getting everything that comes through that open border. And if people don't believe that, they need to pull their head out of the sand because it's happening here.” Lauri Badura on losing her son to a fentanyl overdose“My son, absolutely, was a victim of bad policy. It’s tough to sit here and look at that [chart]. It makes you mad. My son, his name’s Archie. I lost him in 2014. Never in my life would I have expected that this is how my family – I would have one child left – his name is Augie. He’s 25. It was a substance that was laced with fentanyl. In 2014, you didn’t hear of that. That wasn’t happening. It was a very terrible spot to be in at that time.“Since 2014, eight years, I never expected we would be where we are. I was hoping that I wouldn’t have to be as involved as I am now. I’m more involved than I’ve ever been.”Brandon Judd on Democrat political rhetoric increasing illegal crossings“We're gonna give you the evidence right here that this was based on rhetoric, that this increase [in illegal crossings] was based on rhetoric. When Border Patrol would take individuals into custody, we are then required to then interview these individuals and they're supposed to be required to ask why are you coming? What is the reason that you're coming? And in the documentation, they would tell us over and over again, that they were coming because they knew that they will ultimately be released, that the cartels were advertising their services around the world, that they were ultimately going to be released come 2020.”Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt on fentanyl laced drugs coming across the southern border“The people that are consuming these drugs, they think ‘I'm only taking LSD,’ ‘I’m only taking cocaine,’ ‘I’m only taking mushrooms,’ ‘I’m only taking ecstasy’ but the reality is you have a high probability of also consuming fentanyl. And it may very well be a deadly dose because obviously, none of these drugs are FDA regulated. The testing, you can't count on what's in it, you can't count on who's selling it to you being accurate and whether or not this dose is going to be lethal. And what we're seeing is drug traffickers now willing to travel to border states to buy particularly M30 pills, that's the street name is M30 and it’s stamped with an M on one side and 30 on the other side, but it's these little blue pills that are actually counterfeit oxycodone, they're manufactured to look like oxycodone and they're coming up here and we're seizing them with our canines detecting them and our drug task forces detecting them primarily on the interstate or seizing them by the thousands. And these drug traffickers tell us they're willing to risk going to border states, because down there, they can buy these pills for 10 or 20 cents a pill and they can sell them in Northeast Wisconsin for $30 to $40 a pill so the return on investment is well worth it in their mind. It is well worth the risk to travel to these border states, pick these drugs up and with the border being an open sieve right now, the drug manufacturers in Mexico are not worried and not spending any time or energy or effort or resources on how they're going to get the drugs across the border.”Mark Morgan on violent crime committed by got-a-ways“Let’s be honest. There are murderers, rapists, pedophiles, aggravated felons and gang members. Now I’m not saying every single one of those million are bad people, but there are countless that are. The question is, how many is enough? How many murderers are you okay with being a part of those million got-a-ways? How many pedophiles, rapists and gang members are you okay with being a part of that million?”### "

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray demanding a complete explanation for the raid on former President Donald Trump’s residence and calling on whistleblowers at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI to hold their agencies accountable.In July 2022, Sen. Johnson sent a letter Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Way, Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Avril Haines and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz regarding whistleblower claims that suggest FBI officials participated in a scheme to undermine derogatory information connected to Hunter Biden by falsely suggesting it was disinformation.This pattern of corruption and lack of transparency by our federal agencies without stated justification “raise serious questions regarding the integrity of the FBI and your agencies ability to do its job without political bias,” wrote Sen. Johnson.Speaking directly to agency whistleblowers, Sen. Johnson added, “If you have witnessed wronging at your agency, please come forward and share your concerns with my office.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-democrats-are-as-detached-from-economic-reality-as-they-are-from-the-truth,"WASHINGTON – On Sunday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) released the following statement after voting against the Democrats' latest big-government spending package.“The Orwellian named ‘Inflation Reduction Act’ will do no such thing, as a number of prominent experts and economic policy groups have indicated. Over 230 economists wrote to Congress saying the bill would increase inflation. The Penn Wharton Budget Model, the Tax Foundation, and the Congressional Budget Office all found the bill won’t lower inflation and may make it worse. The IRS would more than double in size, unleashing 87,000 new enforcement agents on American families. This massive increase of government intrusion would result in the IRS employing more bureaucrats than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI and Border Patrol combined. Last year, the IRS audited Americans earning less than $25,000 a year at five times the rate of other groups. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says that 78% to 90% of the revenue raised from misreported income would likely come from those making under $200,000.  “This bill will not only raise the burden Americans will bear from business tax increases but it will also supercharge the IRS to go after American families at a time when many are simply struggling to pay their bills. Democrats also imposed a new natural gas tax, which could potentially lead to a 17 percent increase in monthly natural gas bills while the Consumer Price Index for energy already rose 41.6 percent since last year. This is a Green Energy Fantasy that will more likely drive the cost of energy up rather than down. “It’s hard to overstate the damage and destructive impact of the self-inflicted wounds imposed on the American economy by the Biden administration and its Democrat enablers in Congress. They are as detached from economic reality as they are from the truth. Giving bad policies a nice name will not prevent the harm they will inflict on us all.”###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-leads-panel-discussion-on-failed-response-to-covid-19,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) led a discussion of medical professionals at Hillsdale College in Washington, D.C. focused on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, federal health agency failures and adverse reactions. Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Robert Malone and Dr. Peter McCullough joined Sen. Johnson on the panel.As the Senate’s leading advocate for early treatment, healthcare freedom, and individuals who have experienced adverse reactions, Sen. Johnson has held numerous events to investigate COVID-19. In June 2021, he held a press conference in Milwaukee with vaccine injured from Wisconsin and around the country. In November 2021, he held a roundtable with vaccine injured and medical experts entitled “Sen. Johnson Expert Panel on Vaccine Mandates.” In January 2022, he held a discussion with medical experts entitled “COVID-19: A Second Opinion,” including the doctors on yesterday’s panel. The senator held two Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearings on early treatment in November and December of 2020. He has also written over 43 oversight letters to our federal health agencies pressing for transparency and accountability as it relates to the administration’s unsuccessful and harmful COVID-19 policies.Sen. Johnson’s opening remarks at the Hillsdale discussion can be found here and highlights are below.On the Biden Administration’s failed COVID-19 response“I don't see how anybody can take a look at the global response, and in particular, the United States response to this pandemic, to COVID, and call it a success. It was a miserable failure even by their own data. The little data that they actually provide the American public. Now, according to Johns Hopkins, we've suffered over a million deaths in the U.S. out of 6.4 million globally.”On the impact of COVID-19 on children“And speaking of children, look at what we did to our children. I think the science is pretty solid that the masks didn't work. They never were going to. Maybe marginally, you know, a couple of percentages. But I'll tell you, one group of individuals we knew upfront masks would never work on was children. Have you ever seen kids wear masks? And yet today we have school systems about ready to open up and probably going to impose masking on our children because the pandemic isn't over. Think about that.”On the “COVID cartel”“The COVID cartel, let me define the COVID cartel for you. It is the Biden administration, it's the federal health agencies, it’s big pharma, it's the legacy corporate mainstream media, and it's the big tech social media giants. That is the COVID cartel. They are the ones that have sabotaged early treatment. They are the ones that have done the censoring, that have limited freedom of speech. They are the ones because of that censorship, because of that sabotage, I would hold largely responsible for the deaths of what do you say, doctors, how many hundreds of thousands of Americans that died because of lack of early treatment?”On the importance of COVID-19 investigation and discussion“So I've rambled on long enough. I really want to get to the doctors here. But what I want to sus out of these doctors is first: complete to a certain extent, what we weren't able to complete in my January 24th of this year event COVID 19: A Second Opinion. We structured that around Dr. McCulloch's four pillars to address the pandemic. Try and limit the spread, early home treatment, hospital treatment and then vaccines. We just ran out of time. We barely scratched the surface, never got the vaccine. So I want to I want to talk about what we know about the vaccines that the media, the COVID cartel, is not conveying to the American public. The American public is not fully informed as they're making these decisions.”###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sens-johnson-hawley-expose-new-whistleblower-allegations-about-biden-failure-to-vet-afghan-evacuees,"WASHINGTON – On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to Department of Defense (DoD) Acting Inspector General Sean O'Donnell calling for an immediate investigation into new DoD whistleblower allegations that the Biden Administration failed to properly vet individuals evacuated from Afghanistan.The whistleblower alleges: “We write to you with concern over new allegations raised by a Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblower. This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office,"" said the Senators.Following Biden’s failed evacuation from Afghanistan, Sen. Johnson has worked diligently to address the outstanding issues related to the disastrous withdrawal. In September 2021, Sen. Johnson introduced the Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act and sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget regarding miscommunications from the Biden Administration about the Afghan screening process. In December 2021, Sen. Johnson sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Department of State Secretary Antony Blinken demanding information on how the agencies are vetting the Afghans and other foreign nationals brought to the U.S.The full text of the letter can be found here or below. August 4, 2022 Sean O’DonnellActing Inspector GeneralDepartment of Defense Dear Acting Inspector General O’Donnell,We write to you with concern over new allegations raised by a Department of Defense (DoD) whistleblower. This information may show the Biden Administration’s failure to vet those evacuated from Afghanistan was even worse than the public was led to believe. The following allegations demand an immediate investigation by your office.You previously issued a report titled “Evaluation of the Screening of Displaced Persons from Afghanistan.”Among other things, you found that “Afghan evacuees were not vetted by the National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC) using all DoD data prior to arriving in” the United States. In particular, we were troubled to learn that DoD “personnel identified Afghans with derogatory information in the DoD [Automated Biometric Identification System] database who were believed to be in the United States.”At the time of the report, DoD “personnel had identified 50 Afghan personnel in the United States with information in DoD records that would indicate potentially significant security concerns,” but we understand that number has risen to at least 65.  These individuals need to be immediately located, fully vetted, and, if appropriate, deported.A patriotic whistleblower paints an even darker picture. According to new allegations, 324 individuals evacuated from Afghanistan were allowed to enter the United States, despite appearing on the DoD’s Biometrically Enabled Watchlist (BEWL). The BEWL—commonly known as “the watch list”—identifies individuals whose biometrics have been collected and determined by analysts to be threats or potential threats to national security, including known suspected terrorists (KST). This is in addition to the reportedly 65 individuals who are known to have entered the country without adequate vetting.Furthermore, the whistleblower alleges that political appointees at the National Security Council (NSC) and DoD instructed agency personnel to cut corners when processing evacuees in Afghanistan and at staging bases in Europe, also known as “lily pads.” According to the whistleblower rather than administer fingerprint tests on all ten fingers, personnel were told to abbreviate their tests in order to promote the rushed evacuation from Afghanistan.Finally, it is alleged that personnel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who work on vetting Afghan evacuees have been authorized to delete old biometric data, whenever they personally believed that such information is out of date. This is a troubling development that could threaten national security and public safety.We write to request you open an immediate investigation into these alarming allegations and specifically respond to the following:Sincerely, ### "

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/biden-trying-to-redefine-his-way-out-of-recession,"Last week we learned officially what many of us already felt. The U.S. economy shrank for the second quarter in a row. That's a recession. The first step in solving any problem is admitting you have one. Redefining recession won't make the reality go away. Joe Biden and his enablers in Congress are incapable of fixing the problem they caused. We can't expect the arsonists to put out the fire.The Biden Administration is trying to redefine what a recession is, but that's not going to change the reality. We have record gasoline prices and 40-year high inflation. These are self-inflicted wounds caused by Democrat policies.Our veterans deserve support from Congress for conditions they develop as a result of their service to our country which is why I voted for final passage of the PACT Act.Unfortunately, Democrats played politics with this bill. It could have passed last week had Chuck Schumer allowed amendment votes.Read more here.During a Senate hearing last week, I put out an appeal to whistleblowers. If your agency has lost its credibility and is not operating with integrity, please come forward. We need to hear from you. These problems are not going to correct themselves.We especially need whistleblowers at our federal health agencies. We need to restore integrity and credibility to those agencies. Our COVID response was a miserable failure largely because health agencies were not transparent.This lack of transparency must end. Americans deserve the truth.July 30 was National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. The resolution recognizes the brave contributions of whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, abuse and violations of laws and regulations of the United States, dating back to its earliest days.On July 30, 1778, the Continental Congress unanimously passed the first whistleblower legislation in the United States, stating that ""it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge."" The resolution reaffirms these principles, and calls on federal agencies to support and encourage whistleblowers to properly disclose knowledge of fraud, waste or misconduct.It was a whistleblower who brought to light claims that suggest FBI officials participated in a scheme to undermine derogatory information connected to Hunter Biden by falsely suggesting it was disinformation.If these whistleblower allegations are accurate, the FBI can no longer be trusted to investigate Hunter Biden with integrity and equal application of the law.Read more about my letter to the Attorney General, FBI and others here.We have a two-tiered system of justice right now. One for powerful Democrats and their friends and one for the rest of Americans. It is truly a sad state of affairs when the public can't trust the FBI.The CDC is giving conflicting statements about if it is doing mandated data mining of COVID-19 adverse events. This calls into question their integrity and transparency and is just another example of why Americans have completely lost faith in federal health agencies.Read more in the Washington Examiner.Read another letter from me to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky demanding answers."
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sens-johnson-and-peters-introduce-bill-to-protect-communities-from-unmanned-aircraft-systems,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced The Safeguarding the Homeland from the Threats Posed by Unmanned Aircraft Systems Act to enhance our nation’s ability to counter threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), commonly known as drones. On Wednesday, the bill was advanced by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and now moves to the full Senate for consideration.In 2018, as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen. Johnson introduced the Preventing Emerging Threats Act to provide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) with necessary tools to effectively counter UAS. The 2022 legislation will renew and expand the existing authorities – which are set to expire in October.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates that by 2024 about 2.3 million UAS will be registered to fly in U.S. airspace. The increasing numbers of registered UAS create a higher risk of both unintentional disasters and malicious activity from foreign adversaries or criminal organizations that seek to weaponize drones or engage in illegal activities, such as the trafficking of illicit drugs across U.S. borders.“The threats posed by malicious unmanned aircraft are too great to ignore. This bill will increase our ability to fight the growing threat of criminal drone activity across the country. It is paramount that our national security agencies have the tools they need to mitigate the serious threats posed by UAS. I hope my colleagues move quickly to support this bill that will further our national security,” said Sen. Johnson.On July 14, 2022, Sen. Johnson participated in a hearing with senior federal officials to discuss the actions government agencies are taking to combat this evolving threat.Sens. Johnson and Peters were joined on the bill by Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).The full text of the bill can be found here.### "
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-votes-to-pass-the-pact-act,"WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) released the following statement after voting to pass the PACT Act.“The Biden administration and Democrats have played politics with this bill, it could have passed last week had Leader Schumer simply done what he did today—allow amendment votes. It’s unfortunate that some chose to exploit this issue for political points with misleading rhetoric. I unequivocally support providing coverage to service members affected by toxic burn pit exposure, and have been consistent in my votes throughout this process. “In June, I voted against cloture to allow for an amendment process. Although amendments weren’t allowed, I ultimately voted for final passage. Last week when the bill came back, I again voted to allow for an amendment process. I supported an amendment to pay for this bill. I supported an amendment to fix an extraneous provision in the bill that could be used to allow an additional $400 billion dollars in spending unrelated to veterans over the next 10 years. And I supported an amendment to address testimony given earlier this year from VA Secretary McDonough suggesting the VA may not have the capacity to handle the increased volume of claims created by this bill.“Our veterans deserve high quality care in a timely manner and the Community Care program was designed to do exactly that. Although these amendments were not ultimately adopted, our veterans deserve quality care from the VA and support from Congress for conditions they develop as a result of their service to our country, and I again voted for final passage.”###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) introduced a resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of the attack at the Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin on August 5, 2012. This resolution honors the memory of seven worshipers who lost their lives and recognizes the bravery of first responders on the scene. In 2013, Sen. Johnson introduced a similar resolution commemorating the one-year anniversary of the tragic attack.“Today, we remember the victims and family members impacted by the horrific attack on the Sikh Temple a decade ago. We remember those who lost their lives in this unnecessary tragedy. I especially want to highlight the heroism of two officers of the Oak Creek Police Department who acted bravely in the aftermath of the attack, Lieutenant Brian Murphy and Officer Savan Lenda. I am grateful for their service and dedication to the people of Wisconsin,” said Sen. Johnson.Sen. Johnson is joined on the resolution by Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-presses-irs-on-backlog-of-tax-returns,"WASHINGTON – On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Charles Rettig requesting information on the backlog of tax returns preventing millions of Americans from receiving refunds. Over the last 18 months, Congress has appropriated substantial additional funding to improve IRS processing operations, but no noticeable improvements have been made in the backlog of tax returns or processing times.After hearing frustrations from constituents about delayed refunds in July 2021, Sen. Johnson sent a similar letter requesting information on actions the IRS was taking to improve the processing of tax returns and customer service. One year later, Wisconsinites continue to face the same problem of delayed returns without an adequate explanation from the IRS.“The IRS does not hesitate to penalize and fine taxpayers for late filings and payments, yet it does not hold itself accountable when it does not process taxpayers’ returns in a timely manner.  This is not acceptable to Wisconsinites and all taxpayers,” said Sen. Johnson.Sen. Johnson requests the IRS respond to his letter no later than August 15, 2022 with details on unprocessed tax returns, use of congressional funding and average processing times.The full text of the letter can be found here and below. August 1, 2022The Honorable Charles P. RettigCommissionerInternal Revenue Service1111 Constitution AvenueNW Washington, D.C. 20224Dear Commissioner Rettig:I am writing to you regarding the longstanding issue of delayed processing of Wisconsinites’ tax returns. I wrote to you on July 26, 2021, seeking information about the IRS’s backlog on returns.[1] I asked what the average time was to process 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax returns. Additionally, I asked what actions the IRS was taking to streamline the processing of tax returns and improve customer service. I appreciate your response on August 27, 2021. However, a year since my letter, I continue to receive hundreds of complaints from Wisconsinites waiting for their 2021 returns and now are still waiting on their 2022 returns.My constituents’ frustration is confirmed by watchdog and press reports that the IRS continues to struggle in processing returns in a timely and efficient manner.[2] In the August 27, 2021, response, the IRS reported a backlog of 15.9 million individual returns, of which 6.9 million were paper returns and 9 million were returns suspended for additional processing.[3] Nearly a year later, on June 22, 2022, the National Taxpayer Advocate’s annual report found that, as of May 27, 2022, the IRS had a paper backlog of 10.5 million individual returns and 7.4 million business returns.[4] Additionally, the IRS still needed to classify 3.4 million returns as individual or business returns.[5] As Politico reported, this report “contradicts the Biden administration’s repeated claims that it is catching up on the filings.”[6] The National Taxpayer Advocate, Erin Collins, noted, “Over the past year, refund delays on paper-filed returns have generally exceeded six months, with delays of ten months or more common for many taxpayers.”[7] According to Collins, pre-COVID pandemic, “the IRS typically delivered refunds to paper filers within four to six weeks.”[8]On May 18, 2022, you testified before the House Appropriations subcommittee the IRS needed additional funding to improve its processing operations.[9] However, Congress has already appropriated billions in additional funding over the last 18 months. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan (ARPA) provided the IRS $1.5 billion in additional funding.[10] After that, the Fiscal Year 2022 (FY 22) omnibus bill further increased the IRS’s budget by an additional $675 million.[11] Collins noted, “Had the IRS quickly used some of the $1.5 billion of additional funds provided by [ARPA], which was enacted 15 months ago, to hire and train additional employees, it could have worked through the backlog, answered more taxpayer telephone calls and otherwise improved taxpayer service.”[12] Collins further elaborated, “Had the IRS implemented 2-D barcoding, optical character recognition or similar technology in time for the 2022 filing season, it could have reduced the need for employees to engage in the highly manual task of transcribing paper tax returns.”[13] All of these missed opportunities reported by Collins occurred despite an increase in funding.[14]The IRS does not hesitate to penalize and fine taxpayers for late filings and payments, yet it does not hold itself accountable when it does not process taxpayers’ returns in a timely manner.  This is not acceptable to Wisconsinites and all taxpayers.  Therefore, I request the following information:     Please provide this material as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. on August 15, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.Sincerely,      ### [1] See Letter from U.S. Senator Ron Johnson to Charles P.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and their colleagues in the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus in a resolution celebrating July 30 as National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. The resolution, which passed unanimously in the Senate, recognizes the brave contributions of whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, abuse and violations of laws and regulations of the United States, dating back to its earliest days.On July 30, 1778, the Continental Congress unanimously passed the first whistleblower legislation in the United States, stating that “it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other the inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.” The resolution reaffirms these principles, and calls on federal agencies to support and encourage whistleblowers to properly disclose knowledge of fraud, waste or misconduct.Sen. Johnson was joined on the resolution by the full roster of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus including Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Avril Haines, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Christopher Wray and Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael Horowitz regarding whistleblower claims that suggest FBI officials participated in a scheme to undermine derogatory information connected to Hunter Biden by falsely suggesting it was disinformation.The senator raised concerns about an FBI briefing he received on August 6, 2020 while he was conducting a thorough investigation into Hunter Biden’s questionable business dealings.  This FBI briefing was not specific and unconnected to his congressional investigation yet he suspected it was a set-up to discredit his ongoing work relating to Hunter Biden.Recent whistleblower allegations revealed that in August 2020 the FBI “opened an assessment . . . to improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation and caused investigative activity to cease.” The senator wrote, “If these recent whistleblower revelations are true, it would strongly suggest that the FBI’s August 6, 2020 briefing was indeed a targeted effort to intentionally undermine a Congressional investigation. The FBI being weaponized against two sitting chairmen of U.S. Senate committees with constitutional oversight responsibilities would be one of the greatest episodes of Executive Branch corruption in American history.”The senator added, “Unfortunately, the FBI can no longer be trusted to investigate Hunter Biden with integrity and the equal application of law.”Senator Johnson called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to investigate the FBI’s August 2020 briefing and noted that if that office “is unwilling or unable to conduct an investigation into the potential political targeting of U.S. Senators by Federal law enforcement entities, then the appointment of a Special Counsel would be fully justified and long overdue.”Read more about the letter in Fox News.The full letter can be found here and below. July 26, 2022 The Honorable Merrick GarlandAttorney GeneralDepartment of Justice The Honorable Avril HainesDirector of National Intelligence The Honorable Christopher A. WrayDirectorFederal Bureau of Investigation The Honorable Michael E. HorowitzInspector GeneralDepartment of Justice Dear Attorney General Garland, Directors Haines and Wray, and Inspector General Horowitz:                Yesterday, Senator Grassley sent a letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealing information that may confirm what I have suspected for years: “[T]here was a scheme in place among certain FBI officials to undermine derogatory information connected to Hunter Biden by falsely suggesting it was disinformation.”[1]                 Based on whistleblower information, Senator Grassley wrote that, “in August 2020, FBI Supervisory Intelligence Analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment which was used by a FBI Headquarters team to improperly discredit negative Hunter Biden information as disinformation and caused investigative activity to cease.”[2]  That same month, on August 6, 2020, Senator Grassley and I received a briefing from the FBI which we always assumed was a set up to intentionally discredit our ongoing work into Hunter Biden’s extensive foreign financial entanglements.  Indeed, months after that briefing—which was not specific and unconnected to our investigation—it was leaked to the Washington Post who reported on it and tied it to “an extensive effort by the [FBI] to alert members of Congress . . . that they faced a risk of being used to further Russia’s attempt to influence the election’s outcome[.]”[3]If these recent whistleblower revelations are true, it would strongly suggest that the FBI’s August 6, 2020 briefing was indeed a targeted effort to intentionally undermine a Congressional investigation.  The FBI being weaponized against two sitting chairmen of U.S. Senate committees with constitutional oversight responsibilities would be one of the greatest episodes of Executive Branch corruption in American history.                For nearly two years I have sought to get information from the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) about the purpose of, and who ordered, this briefing.  On May 3, 2021, Senator Grassley and I reiterated these requests in a letter to Directors Wray and Haines.[4]  Both failed to provide complete responses.[5]                The inability of FBI and ODNI to be transparent with Congress on this matter and other matters relating to Hunter Biden is deeply concerning.  Once again, the FBI’s integrity has been called into question.  If these whistleblower allegations are accurate, how can your agency, Director Wray, be capable of investigating the president’s son?  Unfortunately, the FBI can no longer be trusted to investigate Hunter Biden with integrity and the equal application of law.                 Attorney General Garland, you have failed to provide Senator Grassley and me with assurances that any DOJ investigation into Hunter Biden’s potential criminal activity will be free of conflicts of interest.  The American people should not have to tolerate your silence any longer.Inspector General Horowitz, on July 20, 2021, Senator Grassley and I requested you “begin an immediate review and investigation relating to the Justice Department’s and FBI’s process and procedure to prepare for and provide defensive and counterintelligence briefings with particular emphasis on the August 6, 2020, briefing[.]”[6]  Has your office requested records and materials from the FBI and DOJ relating to the August 6, 2020 briefing?  If not why not?  If so, when did DOJ and FBI produce records, and when will you report your findings to us? The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) may be able to provide an objective review of this matter, but it has not been forthcoming to Senator Grassley or me.  If the OIG is unwilling or unable to conduct an investigation into the potential political targeting of U.S. Senators by federal law enforcement entities, then the appointment of a Special Counsel would be fully justified and long overdue. Sincerely,###[1] Letter from Sen.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-johnson-calls-for-transparency-and-compliance-from-federal-agencies,"WASHINGTON – On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, called on federal agencies to be transparent and comply with congressional oversight during a hearing with Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The hearing focused on the corruption, misconduct and long-term failures of U.S. Penitentiary Atlanta (USPA), a federal prison in Georgia.The Department of Justice repeatedly obstructed Sens. Johnson and Ossoff’s 10-month investigation into USPA. DOJ’s obstruction ultimately resulted in Sens. Johnson and Ossoff issuing a subpoena for Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal’s appearance at the hearing.“My six years as chairman of the committee certainly opened up my eyes at how weakened congressional oversight has become over the years.  We have very limited enforcement power. As a result, the agencies just thumb their nose at us. I think you saw that here. These are legitimate issues. These are long standing problems. The fact that the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons weren't fully cooperating with this is absurd,” said Sen. Johnson.Senator Johnson submitted an opening statement for the record, which can be found here.Watch the full hearing here.Excerpts can be found below.On Lack of Transparency“It is that arrogance. It is that lack of transparency. It is that dishonesty that have Americans losing confidence in these institutions that, quite honestly, they need to have confidence in. It's an unsustainable state of affairs in a democracy when the chief federal law enforcement division, the FBI, can't be trusted - can’t be trusted to be nonpolitical and shows themselves to be completely political. When the Department of Justice blocks our ability to talk to one of their directors with legitimate oversight. When our federal health agencies have not been honest and transparent regarding a pandemic. So this lack of transparency has to end and congressional oversight needs to be kicked into high gear.”On the Importance of Whistleblowers“If you are a whistleblower in the Department of Justice, the FBI, please come forward. If you want to restore integrity and credibility to your agencies, come forward and tell Congress so the American people understand the truth.  I would also make that appeal to people working in our federal health agencies. Our response to COVID has been a miserable failure, largely because our health agency have not been transparent. I've written 43 oversight letters to the agencies. Where I've gotten responses, they're non-responsive responses. Generally, I don't even get answers. This lack of transparency must end. We must restore congressional oversight because the American people deserve the truth.”On Congressional Oversight“The reason I'm asking these questions is congressional oversight has been significantly weakened over the years. I'm fully aware of it. I understand the full frustration of members of Congress trying to get the truth to the American public. That's our job. Okay. But the agencies thumb their nose at Congress with impunity. So to me, this is as important as your testimony is in terms of the problems at Atlanta, maybe even a bigger issue for me in this hearing is – why did it take a subpoena to get the director of the Bureau of Prisons to come here and testify before us to help us conduct our oversight? What is going on in the Department of Justice that they refuse to be transparent until Congress, the Senate, has to issue them a subpoena? You know, we bring department heads before our committees, have them testify before us. We almost always ask them the question – will you comply with congressional oversight requests?”On DOJ Obstruction“Again, I appreciate you coming here. What I don't appreciate is how difficult it was to get you here. And I don't appreciate, again, from my standpoint, the obstruction to this committee's investigation, our oversight, by somebody in the Department of Justice. I don't think it was this fella from the Office of Legislative Affairs. I think somebody else or some other persons didn't want this hearing to occur or did not want to cooperate with this investigation. So, again, I give kudos to the chairman for pursuing this against resistance and obstruction. I think we see why this is so important. There are some serious problems and they have not been effectively addressed. They haven't. I wish they had been. These are outstanding issues for years. Somebody’s got to be held accountable.”###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-johnson-points-out-conflicting-cdc-statements-on-surveillance-of-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-events,"WASHINGTON – On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson sent a follow-up letter to Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), demanding clarity on whether the agency performed sufficient surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events. Recent conflicting statements by CDC officials about monitoring adverse events called into question CDC’s integrity and transparency.In a June 2022 letter to the CDC, Sen. Johnson outlined the CDC’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document dated January 29, 2021, in which the agency claimed it would “perform routine [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)] surveillance to identify potential new safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccines.”  The SOP also stated that the “CDC will perform Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis . . . to identify [adverse events]” and “perform PRR data mining on a weekly basis or as needed.”However, in response to a May 9, 2022 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the CDC wrote, “no PRRs were conducted.”Dr. John Su, a CDC official on the agency’s Vaccine Safety Team, recently said the opposite to a media outlet claiming that the “CDC has been performing PRRs since Feb 2021, and continues to do so to date.”The senator wrote, “CDC’s assertion and Dr. Su’s statement cannot both be true.”“The American people deserve the truth and you have not been providing it. That is why I, together with millions of Americans, have completely lost faith in the CDC and other federal health agencies.

Walensky, MD, MPHDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Dear Director Walensky:                 On June 23, 2022, I wrote to you about whether the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performed sufficient surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events (enclosed).[1]  To date, the CDC has failed to provide a response to that letter.                In that letter, I described the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document dated January 29, 2021, which declared that the agencies would “perform routine [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)] surveillance to identify potential new safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccines.”[2]  Yet, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for these surveillance records, CDC failed to provide data it originally claimed it would generate.[3]As I noted in my letter, the SOP stated that “CDC will perform Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis  . . . to identify [adverse events] that are disproportionately reported relative to other [adverse events].”[4]  The SOP also stated that, “CDC will perform PRR data mining on a weekly basis or as needed.”[5]  However, in response to the May 9, 2022 FOIA request for these records, CDC wrote, “no PRRs were conducted” and that “data mining is outside of th [sic] agency’s purview.”[6]                The validity of this assertion has recently been called into question.  Although CDC claimed that “no PRRs were conducted,” Dr. John Su, a CDC official that works on the Vaccine Safety Team, reportedly told a media outlet that “CDC has been performing PRRs since Feb 2021, and continues to do so to date.”[7]  CDC’s assertion and Dr. Su’s statement cannot both be true.                The American people deserve the truth and you have not been providing it. That is why I, together with millions of Americans, have completely lost faith in the CDC and other federal health agencies.  It is time to start regaining their confidence and your agency’s integrity by coming clean, being transparent, and telling the truth.                Accordingly, please provide an immediate and complete response to my June 23, 2022 letter and the following information by no later than July 29, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###[1] Letter from Senator Ron Johnson, to Rochelle Walensky, Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, June 23, 2022, https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/services/files/9914278B-A73B-4434-8349-91091138E18B.[2] Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jan. 29, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/VAERS-v2-SOP.pdf at 3.[3] Josh Guetzkow, New FOIA Release Shows CDC Lied About Its VAERS Safety Monitoring Efforts, Substack, June 16, 2022, https://jackanapes.substack.com/p/new-foia-release-shows-cdc-lied-about.[4] Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jan. 29, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/VAERS-v2-SOP.pdf at 11.[5] Id. at 16.[6] Letter from Roger Andoh, FOIA Officer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to Divyanshi Dwivedi, Children’s Health Defense, June 16, 2022, https://jackanapes.substack.com/api/v1/file/afc9ad6a-9330-4a80-a2c2-5f3bde28422e.pdf.[7] Zachary Stieber, EXCLUSIVE: CDC Says It Performed Vaccine Safety Data Mining After Saying It Didn’t, Epoch Times, July 23, 2022, https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-says-it-performed-vaccine-safety-data-mining-after-saying-it-didnt_4617563.html; John Su, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Vaccine Safety Team, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jan. 5, 2022, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-01-05/02-covid-su-508.pdf.[8] Zachary Stieber, EXCLUSIVE: CDC Says It Performed Vaccine Safety Data Mining After Saying It Didn’t, Epoch Times, July 23, 2022, https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-says-it-performed-vaccine-safety-data-mining-after-saying-it-didnt_4617563.html.[9] Letter from Roger Andoh, FOIA Officer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to Divyanshi Dwivedi, Children’s Health Defense, June 16, 2022, https://jackanapes.substack.com/api/v1/file/afc9ad6a-9330-4a80-a2c2-5f3bde28422e.pdf."

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/7/sen-johnson-joins-sen-daines-colleagues-in-letter-demanding-va-improve-community-care-of-veterans,"WASHINGTON – Last week, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and seven of their Republican colleagues in a letter demanding the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reaffirm its commitment to veterans and ensure they have access to quality health care in a timely manner. The MISSION Act of 2018 established the VA’s commitment to providing veterans access to quality community health care providers. This letter demands answers as to why the VA fell short of their promises.“Veterans deserve access to quality health care in a timely manner and the VA’s failure to do so and willful disregard for established standards is unacceptable,” the Senators wrote.“We ask you reaffirm the VA's commitment to veterans and your relationship with Congress by addressing the VA's apparently intentional non-compliance with the spirit and legal standards of the MISSION Act. We look forward to prompt communications with our offices, your immediate action to ensure complete veteran access to community care, and an immediate reversal of any VA practices or policies that violate the law,” the Senators continued.Sens. Johnson and Daines are joined on the letter by Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Ted Cruz (R-Texas).The full text of the letter can be found here and below.July 14, 2022The Honorable Denis R. McDonough Department of Veterans Affairs Dear Secretary McDonough,We write to raise our serious concerns regarding the Veteran Healthcare Administration's refusal to provide adequate access to community care as authorized by the VA MISSION Act of 2018. Veterans across the country are subject to unacceptably long waiting periods to receive care or have appointments continually rescheduled because the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) refuses to follow guidance and statute created by the MISSION Act. Veterans deserve access to quality health care in a timely manner and the VA's failure to do so and willful disregard for established standards is unacceptable.The VA MISSION Act modernized the Veterans Community Care program, which prescribed clear and concise access standards and eligibility criteria to ensure veteran access to non-VA providers. These standards, which passed both the House and Senate by overwhelming, bipartisan majorities in 2018, preserved and enhanced vital care for veterans subjected to overly long waiting times to receive care, those who live in rural areas without access to VA care facilities, or those who are best served by non-VA care as determined by their doctor. The MISSION Act's innovations promised to provide care for underserved veterans across the country, but the VA currently stands in the way of fulfilling that promise.On a weekly basis, our constituents voice concerns and present evidence that the VA is ignoring these guidelines in an effort to reduce community care, and ultimately deny mandated care to eligible veterans. In some cases, the VA is rescheduling care without the veteran's consent. In other cases, the VA is seemingly ignoring the veteran's best medical interest. Most alarmingly, there are reports of internal VA training materials that are actually pushing to reduce community care while the VA decommissions and closes the Office of Community Care and shuts down the VA Mission Act website (missionact.va.gov). These essential policies and program offices were stood up to prevent the tragedies of the Phoenix Waitlist Scandal and are directly linked to protecting the quality and accessibility of veteran health care.Additionally, there have been significant concerns with the timeliness of which Congress has been able to both simply schedule briefings and receive requested data. During your confirmation hearing, you stated that ""the free flow of accurate data is the lifeblood of a well-functioning organization."" We urge you to reassess whether this commitment is being upheld, and the collaborative relationship that you hold with your stakeholders in Congress.We ask you reaffirm the VA's commitment to veterans and your relationship with Congress by addressing the VA's apparently intentional non-compliance with the spirit and legal standards of the MISSION Act. We look forward to prompt communications with our offices, your immediate action to ensure complete veteran access to community care, and an immediate reversal of any VA practices or policies that violate the law.Sincerely, ###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) visited McAllen, Texas to witness first-hand the horrors of Joe Biden’s border crisis. As the former Chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Sen Johnson visited the border several times, most recently in March 2021. President Joe Biden has not visited the border as President. While in Texas, Sen. Johnson participated in a night tour with law enforcement and an aerial tour led by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Additionally, he met with local landowners to discuss the impact of open borders on Texas communities, spoke with CBP about the challenges they face while securing the border and received a briefing from Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety about state efforts to maintain safety and security along the 1,254 mile border.Following his visit, Sen. Johnson participated in a press conference with his Senate Republican colleagues. Senator Johnson’s remarks can be found here and below.“I want to thank Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz for hosting us. I want to thank all of our hosts. I want to thank the men and women of Customs and Border Protection who are not given the support they deserve from this administration. I want to thank the members of the news media for showing up to cover this. Unfortunately, most of the mainstream media have just turned a blind eye to this travesty. “As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, I've been down to the border many times. I always learn something new. But I wish I could adequately convey, on a personal level to anybody listening to me, how profoundly disturbing it is.  “As Ted described, last night to encounter two little girls unaccompanied with just a little piece of paper in a plastic bag with their birth certificate and an address and a phone number to connect them to somebody they know here in this country. Anybody who is a father or a grandfather, has a daughter or a granddaughter – think of a six or seven year old put in the hands of some of the most evil people on the planet.  “I had not heard of the rape tree, the panty tree, the taunting tree. I had never heard of that. Our last trip down here, we saw dead bodies floating in the Rio Grande. In my hearings, I've heard of children being sold for $84. How do you think the young women pay off their five, six, seven, $8,000 human trafficking fee. I think we all know. “In our briefing a little bit earlier with Customs and Border Protection, just in this sector, they were describing how many encounters they have per week – 23,000. Now calculated, that generates for those human traffickers $153 million a week. Just do a simple back of the envelope calculation – that translates to $18.3 billion per year. That’s what the human traffickers are generating in revenue just from the people Border Patrol encountered. Think of all got-a-ways.  “So ever since President Biden entered office and dismantled all the successful programs that had pretty well secured the border, stopped the flow of unaccompanied children and family units exploiting our laws. We had actually reduced the number of single adults coming across the border. He dismantled all of those programs.  “I've been saying that his administration is facilitating the multibillion dollar business model of some of the most evil people on the planet. And you come down here and you just get a small sense of the deprivations, and it is profoundly disturbing.   “But let me end by just – this is available, I've got copies on my website. This is a chart I started back in about 2015 as I was tracking the number of unaccompanied children that turned into a humanitarian crisis under Obama. That's what he called it with 2000 people a day. The last couple of months, we've had over 7,700 people per day. Overwhelming border patrol, opening up the lanes for the deadly drugs that are impacting and killing Americans in every state of the union, including Wisconsin. But I refer you to this chart because what it shows you is the cause and effect. This didn't just happen. This isn't ‘oh boy Joe Biden is unlucky.’ “Open borders, a flood of illegal immigrants, a flood of deadly drugs, 40 year high inflation, record gasoline prices – these things didn't just happen. These are the direct result of his policies. But if you look very closely at this chart, we pretty well had the border solved. That's just another tragedy here. We had this problem fixed until Democrat presidential candidates started talking about the fact they would not deport and they would offer illegal immigrants free health care. “So single adult illegal intrusions increased, and then of course, when Joe Biden became president, he completely opened up the borders. So I call on President Biden. I call on Vice President Harris. I call on Secretary Mayorkas. Come down here to the border. You witness these depredations. You experience the profound level of being troubled by what you witnessed. But you must come here and witness it.”###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and all 49 of their Republican colleagues in a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify the Biden administration’s new regulation, “National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions,” that will further bog down the already-onerous federal permitting process and add further delay to building vital infrastructure projects and putting hard-working Americans back to work. The recently enacted Biden administration NEPA rules, authored by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), substantially roll-back the Trump administration’s 2020 NEPA regulations, which were the first major modernization of federal environmental reviews since 1978.The CRA provides Congress an expedited mechanism to overturn certain federal agency regulations and actions through a joint resolution of disapproval. A joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA is afforded special procedures, bypassing normal Senate rules and allowing for a vote on the Senate floor. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is approved by a simple majority in both houses of Congress and signed by the President—or if Congress successfully overrides a presidential veto—the rule is invalidated.Sens.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray, and United States Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss demanding a thorough investigation of Hunter Biden’s potentially criminal behavior.A recent article revealed evidence further corroborating the facts highlighted in the senators’ September 2020 report about Hunter Biden’s questionable financial transactions.  Specifically, the Washington Examiner published Hunter Biden’s text messages apparently showing him discussing payment for escorts associated with a company which at one time had locations in Russia and Ukraine.  In 2020, based on records in their possession, the senators reported, “Hunter Biden paid nonresident women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine” and that some transactions are linked to what “appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.”In their letter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI, the senators wrote, “Rather than take these disturbing revelations seriously, the partisan press quickly rushed to dispel any notion of potential wrongdoing connected to Hunter Biden.” The senators added, “These findings of potentially criminal behavior must be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement entities according to the highest ethical standards. Yet, due to your agencies’ continued failure to provide Congress with answers to its legitimate oversight questions, we have serious concerns about your review of this matter as well as the ongoing Hunter Biden criminal case.”As a result of DOJ’s failure to be transparent with Congress about taking necessary steps to avoid conflicts with respect to the Hunter Biden criminal case, the senators asked: “What is the Justice Department trying to hide from Congress and the American people?”Read more about the letter in the Washington Examiner.The full text of the letter can be found here and

AttorneyDistrict of Delaware Dear Attorney General Garland, Director Wray and U.S. Attorney Weiss:On June 27, 2022, the Washington Examiner reported that Joe Biden may have unwittingly financed Hunter Biden’s “participation in an escort ring tied to Russia.”   According to the article, on January 2, 2019, Hunter Biden exchanged text messages with “Eva,” short for “Moreva,” who served as the go-between for the reported escorts.   The article noted that Joe Biden committed to wiring Hunter Biden approximately $100,000 from December 2018 through January 2019.   The Washington Examiner revealed that Hunter Biden spent approximately $30,000 on escorts between November 2018 and March 2019.   According to the report, evidence of the spending is based on Wells Fargo wire receipts, Zelle receipts, PayPal notices and pictures of cashier checks.   Many of these escorts reportedly used a “.ru” email address.   In one text exchange with “Eva,” Hunter Biden reportedly wrote that “Email with .ru flags wires.”   He then reportedly texted that the money he tried to wire was “too much red flag for bank.”   The report indicated that after Hunter Biden received account information for a wire transfer, he texted “Eva,” “That its [sic] what got my accounts frozen and reviewed by bank[,] Send me Julia and I will give her the cash[.]” “Eva” and the reported escorts were apparently associated with a company called UberGFE, which at one time had locations in Russia and Ukraine.   In our September 2020 report, we noted that records in our possession indicated that “Hunter Biden paid nonresident women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine” and that some transactions are linked to what “appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.”Rather than take these disturbing revelations seriously, the partisan press quickly rushed to dispel any notion of potential wrongdoing connected to Hunter Biden.  Instead of investigating potential links between Hunter Biden and human trafficking rings, the media falsely characterized our findings as “little more than a rehashing of unproven allegations that echoed a Russian disinformation campaign.”  These findings of potentially criminal behavior must be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement entities according to the highest ethical standards.  Yet, due to your agencies’ continued failure to provide Congress with answers to its legitimate oversight questions, we have serious concerns about your review of this matter as well as the ongoing Hunter Biden criminal case. With respect to that criminal case, we’ve made our ongoing concerns clear with respect to DOJ’s handling of it.  Most recently, on May 9, 2022, we wrote to U.S. Attorney (USA) David Weiss with respect to our concerns about conflicts of interest infecting the criminal investigation.   In that letter, we reiterated our concerns about Nicholas McQuaid’s conflicts with the Hunter Biden criminal case in light of his prior working relationship with Hunter Biden’s criminal defense attorney.  We also asked USA Weiss whether, in light of the Biden family’s connections in Delaware, anyone in his office is recused from the matter.   We also asked whether USA Weiss “received sufficient resources and support from the Justice Department to properly execute the Hunter Biden criminal case.”   On June 9, 2022, the Justice Department interceded and instead of USA Weiss responding, it responded on his behalf.  In that response, the Justice Department failed – yet again – to answer any questions.  To date, the Biden administration has refused to answer whether there have been any recusals from the Hunter Biden criminal case based on conflicts of interest or other reasons.               What is the Justice Department trying to hide from Congress and the American people?Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure the proper execution of, and compliance with, conflicts of interest laws and regulations.  DOJ’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations will undermine the integrity of any investigation and cast a public cloud – whether warranted or not – over the matter.  Your continued failure to answer fundamental questions with respect to the Hunter Biden criminal case not only calls into question DOJ’s and FBI’s handling of the matter, it calls into question whether DOJ and FBI will take the necessary steps to pursue other relevant investigative threads.              Accordingly, please answer the following no later than July 21, 2022:Sincerely,###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/7/victory-for-life,"It's been a week since the U.S. Supreme Court released its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. This is a victory for life and for those who have fought for decades to protect the unborn. (The photo above is from the annual March for Life held on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade that many Wisconsinites have attended over the decades.)For almost fifty years the decision of nine unelected Justices have prevented a democratically derived consensus on the profound moral issue of abortion to be formed. This decision will now allow that democratic process to unfold in each state to determine at what point does society have the responsibility to protect life. Hopefully, the debate will be conducted with sincerity, compassion, and respect for the broad range of views that people hold.This week's horrifying tragedy near the border with 53 migrants dying in the back of a tractor trailer puts a tragic spotlight on what I have been saying for over 16 months. President Biden's open border policy is facilitating the multi-billion dollar business model of some of the most evil people on the planet. It leads to this tragic human depredation.Last week, I sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding answers about reports that DHS is using taxpayer dollars to reimburse nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that transport illegal aliens across the country. The letter requested information on a recently reported DHS plan to pay for buses and flights for illegal aliens directly.I joined my Republican colleagues from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen demanding answers on how the Department prepared for inflation early in 2021. We want records pertaining to the American Rescue Plan, specifically those regarding the Treasury's actions to combat the known dangers of inflation following the reckless spending spree after the bill's passage in March 2021.It is long past time to share vital information on the discussions and actions debated within the Biden administration to identify, address, and prevent the historic inflation facing our country today.Washington Examiner: Demanding documents about inflationTweet: Biden's inflation causing triple whammyDid our federal heath agencies perform sufficient surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events?That's the question I posed to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in the wake of a recent article that noted the CDC did not compile all of the data on vaccine adverse events it initially claimed it would.According to the CDC's Standard Operating Procedures document dated January 29, 2021, the agency claimed it would perform routine [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)] surveillance to identify potential new safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccines. Specifically, the surveillance would include, ""generating tables summarizing automated data from fields on the VAERS form for persons who received COVID-19 vaccines.""The CDC reportedly failed to provide these tables and other surveillance data in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.This raises questions about whether CDC ever collected the information on vaccine safety it originally claimed it would. We need an explanation.I joined 20 of my Republican colleagues in the Senate to introduce the Safe Schools Act.The legislation would allow COVID relief dollars allocated to schools through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund to be used by schools to harden themselves with physical security measures, such as locks, panic buttons, individual room security systems, video surveillance, and hiring and paying the salaries of armed school resource officers. Expenses for school security improvements would be exempt from current ESSER guidelines that require expenses to be related to COVID-19.Many thanks to all the Joseph Project alumni who particpated in our roundtable this week. The stories they shared were inspiring. Many of these graduates were formerly incarcerated but have now found success through work.I had a delicious visit to Widmer's Cheese Cellars in the tiny town of Theresa.

Skyrocketing inflation is a steadily rising and harmful tax which is devastating American families. They deserve answers on what the Biden administration knew about the impending inflation crisis, how government spending would impact it, what coordination it has had with the Federal Reserve about inflation and what plans it had, if any, to fix it. Over a year ago, President Biden and Democrats in Congress shoved through an enormously wasteful “COVID” spending bill, which spurred dangerous inflation we are still facing today. Now, there are reports from the Federal Reserve and others that the American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) massive $2 trillion price tag was completely unnecessary and dangerously injected too much government money into the economy.[1] Regardless of your alleged hesitations, you went on to support and advocate for the multi trillion-dollar package despite its potential harmful effect on the U.S. economy. [2] You also attempted to downplay and reject the concerns of others, including members of Congress, about how this massive spending package would fuel inflation.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky requesting information about whether the agency performed sufficient surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.  A recent article noted that CDC did not compile all of the data on vaccine adverse events it initially claimed it would.According to the CDC’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document dated January 29, 2021, the agency claimed it would “perform routine [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)] surveillance to identify potential new safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccines.” Specifically, the surveillance would include, “generating tables summarizing automated data from fields on the VAERS form for persons who received COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., age of vaccinee, COVID-19 vaccine type, adverse event).” The CDC reportedly failed to provide these tables and other surveillance data in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.  The CDC claimed that, “no information was withheld from [the FOIA] release.”The senator wrote, “This raises questions about whether CDC ever collected the information on vaccine safety it originally claimed it would in the January 2021 SOP.”To the extent that CDC did not generate the surveillance data it initially claimed it would, the senator called on CDC to “explain why and detail who made the decision to not follow the SOP and when that decision was made.”The full text of the letter can be found here and below. June 23, 2022Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPHDirectorCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Dear Director Walensky:               I write regarding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracking of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.  According to a recent article, the CDC failed to provide records responsive to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request relating to the CDC’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document dated January 29, 2021.[1]               This SOP identified how CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would “perform routine [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)] surveillance to identify potential new safety concerns for COVID-19 vaccines.”[2]  Specifically, the surveillance would include, “generating tables summarizing automated data from fields on the VAERS form for persons who received COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., age of vaccinee, COVID-19 vaccine type, adverse event).”[3]  The FOIA request asked CDC to provide these tables, but the agency failed to do so.For example, CDC failed to produce all of the “VAERS weekly tables” listed in the January 29, 2021 SOP.[4]  According to the SOP, these VAERS tables would consist of at least eight different tables including, “all reports [of adverse events] following COVID-19 vaccines by severity and selected manufacturer/brand name” and the “top 25 most frequently reported [adverse events].”[5]  CDC claimed that these tables would be assembled “weekly” and “available every Monday.”[6]  In response to the May 9, 2022 FOIA request, the CDC did not provide all of the requested tables and information.[7]  CDC claimed, however, that “no information was withheld from release.” [8]  This raises questions about whether CDC ever collected the information on vaccine safety it originally claimed that it would in the January 2021 SOP.In addition to CDC’s failure to produce the complete set of the “VAERS weekly tables,” CDC failed to provide other data reports and assessments detailed in the SOP.  For example, the SOP stated that “CDC will perform Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis  . . . to identify [adverse events] that are disproportionately reported relative to other [adverse events].”[9]  The SOP also noted that, “CDC will perform PRR data mining on a weekly basis or as needed.”[10]  However, in response to the May 9, 2022 FOIA request for these records, CDC stated, “no PRRs were conducted[.]”[11]              Public health agencies’ ability to track and warn the public of potential adverse events connected to the COVID-19 vaccines is dependent on those agencies performing routine and thorough data analyses.  As discussed during the October 22, 2020 teleconference on vaccine surveillance systems, a CDC official noted that CDC and FDA planned to use VAERS to conduct “data mining . . . every one to two weeks.”[12]  That official praised VAERS stating that it can “rapidly detect safety signals and can detect rare adverse events.”[13]  Indeed, as of June 10, 2022, VAERS reported 28,859 deaths worldwide following COVID-19 vaccination with 7,890 or 27 percent of those deaths occurring on day 0, 1, or 2 following COVID-19 vaccination.[14]  Given the effectiveness of VAERS to “detect safety signals,” it is unclear why CDC did not generate all the tables using VAERS and other surveillance data on COVID-19 vaccine adverse events even though it initially indicated that it would perform such analyses.               In order to better understand the VAERS data CDC has produced and its apparent decision not to compile certain data detailed in the January 29, 2021 SOP, please provide the following information:Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than July 7, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely, ###[1] Josh Guetzkow, New FOIA Release Shows CDC Lied About Its VAERS Safety Monitoring Efforts, Substack, June 16, 2022, https://jackanapes.substack.com/p/new-foia-release-shows-cdc-lied-about.[2] Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Jan. 29, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/VAERS-v2-SOP.pdf at 3.[3] Id.[4] Josh Guetzkow, New FOIA Release Shows CDC Lied About Its VAERS Safety Monitoring Efforts, Substack, June 16, 2022, https://jackanapes.substack.com/p/new-foia-release-shows-cdc-lied-about;

We strongly supported the Trump Administration’s decision to fully and faithfully implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal and undivided capital of Israel, by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and by closing the U.S. Consulate General for the Palestinians in Jerusalem and merging its functions into the U.S. Embassy’s ‘Palestinian Affairs Unit’ within one diplomatic mission under the authority the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. The Biden Administration’s disregard for that law, however, undermines our nation’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and signals support for dividing Jerusalem.“Let there be no misunderstanding: this unprecedented arrangement—to turn the Palestinian Affairs Unit into a ‘U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs’ that will no longer report to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel but instead report directly to the State Department in Washington, D.C., and to appoint a Special Envoy to the Palestinians—is an effort to open an unofficial and de facto U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Jerusalem. In fact, the Biden Administration admits this decision is one step closer to opening an official U.S. consulate, a plan it refuses to stop pushing despite the Government of Israel’s adamant opposition and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon’s admission to Congress in October 2021 that the United States, under international law, would ‘need to get the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility.’“The Biden Administration’s decision is wrong and not how America should treat Israel, one of our closest allies in the world. As sponsors of the Upholding the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Law Act of 2021 to withhold funding for a U.S. consulate to the Palestinians in Israel’s capital, we unequivocally oppose the Biden Administration’s decision and will use every tool at our disposal to stop it in the 117th Congress and afterwards.”Sen. Johnson, Sen. Hagerty and Rep. Zeldin were joined on the statement by Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Mike Lee (R-Utah), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and 55 members of the House of Representatives.###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-calls-on-unissant-to-answer-further-questions-about-issues-on-dod-s-medical-database,"Encloses a timeline highlighting events relating to DoD’s database and vaccine safetyWASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent a follow-up letter to Kenneth Bonner, President and Chief Growth Officer of Unissant Inc., regarding the company’s management of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED).  The senator has been examining potential data integrity issues on the database and included a timeline in his letter highlighting when DMED data integrity issues occurred and how Unissant and DoD responded to those issues.On Jan. 24, 2022, during Sen. Johnson’s COVID-19: A Second Opinion panel, he discussed DoD whistleblower data that showed significant increases in registered medical diagnoses on DMED in 2021, compared to a five year average from 2016-2020.  Sen. Johnson sent three letters to DoD about the whistleblowers’ allegations and called for a preservation of all DMED records.On Jan. 31, 2022, DoD reportedly claimed that the data in DMED “was incorrect for the years 2016-2020” and that the DMED system was taken offline to “identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption.” To date, Sen. Johnson has not received a substantive response to his letters from DoD, other than to confirm that it “created (and preserved) a full back up of the DMED.”On March 7, 2022, Sen. Johnson wrote to Unissant requesting documents and information about its awareness of DMED’s data integrity issues.  Unissant provided some responsive materials on May 4, 2022. “Based on these Unissant records, it appears that as early as August 2021, the DoD and Unissant were both aware that DMED had data integrity issues, but still allowed DMED to ‘go  live’ with these issues.  Further, in January 2022, DoD and Unissant representatives discussed data issues on DMED with a DoD employee noting on January 31, 2022, that ‘DMED access was restored after the data was corrected,’” Sen. Johnson wrote.Sen. Johnson is calling on Unissant to answer further questions about its management of DMED and clarify the company’s explanation for requesting DoD’s approval to respond to Congressional inquiries.The full text of the letter and a timeline highlighting recent developments relating to DMED and vaccine safety can be found here and below. June 14, 2022Mr. Kenneth BonnerPresident and Chief Growth OfficerUnissant Inc. Dear Mr. Bonner:                On March 7, 2022, I requested Unissant provide records relating to its management of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED).  This request was based on data from three DoD whistleblowers that showed significant increases in registered medical diagnoses on DMED in 2021, compared to a five year average from 2016-2020.[1]  On May 4, 2022, Unissant responded to my letter and provided some responsive materials shedding more light on DMED’s data integrity issues.[2] Based on these Unissant records, it appears that as early as August 2021, the DoD and Unissant were both aware that DMED had data integrity issues, but still allowed DMED to “go live” with these issues.[3]  Further, in January 2022, DoD and Unissant representatives discussed data issues on DMED with a DoD employee noting on January 31, 2022, that “DMED access was restored after the data was corrected.”[4]The timeline below highlights the most relevant developments regarding issues relating to DMED and vaccine safety and helps put some of Unissant’s records into context.  This timeline is based on Unissant’s records, public reporting, and Congressional oversight:Timeline of events relating to DMED and Vaccine SafetyThe records Unissant has provided to date as well as the company’s unclear explanation for requesting DoD’s approval to respond to Congressional inquiries raise additional questions.  Accordingly, please provide the following information by no later than June 28, 2022:Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely, ###[1] COVID-19: A Second Opinion, Rumble, Jan. 24, 2022, https://rumble.com/vt62y6-covid-19-a-second-opinion.html(at 4:54:35).[2] Kenneth Bonner, President, Unissant, to Ron Johnson, Ranking Member, Permanent Subcomm. on Investigations, May 4, 2022 (on file with Subcomm.).[3] Email between Dep’t of Defense and Unissant representatives, Aug. 18, 2021 (on file with Subcomm.); Email between Unissant representatives, Mar. 3, 2022 (on file with Subcomm.).[4] Email from Dep’t of Defense employee to Stephen Gehring Vice President, Unissant, et al., Jan. 31, 2022 (on file with Subcomm.).[5] Patricia Kime, Pentagon Tracking 14 Cases of Heart Inflammation in Troops After COVID-19 Shots, Military.com, April 26, 2021, https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/04/26/pentagon-tracking-14-cases-of-heart-inflammation-troops-after-covid-19-shots.html.[6] COVID-19 VaST Work Group Report – May 17, 2021, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/work-groups-vast/report-2021-05-17.html.[7] Berkeley Lovelace Jr., CDC safety group says there’s a likely link between rare heart inflammation in young people after Covid shot, CNBC, June 23, 2021, https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/cdc-reports-more-than-1200-cases-of-rare-heart-inflammation-after-covid-vaccine-shots.html.[8] Temporary Data Inaccuracies in the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database, Dep’t of Defense, Feb. 15, 2022 (on file with Subcomm.).[9] Id.[10] Emails between Unissant and Dep’t of Defense representatives, Aug. 17-18, 2021 (on file with Subcomm.).[11] Email between Dep’t of Defense and Unissant representatives, Aug. 18, 2021 (on file with Subcomm.).[12] Memorandum from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Senior Pentagon Leadership, et al.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-calls-on-american-board-of-internal-medicine-to-participate-in-covid-19-public-forum,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, U.S. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to CEO and President of the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), Dr. Richard Baron, regarding ABIM’s meeting to determine “whether to recommend any disciplinary sanction against” Dr. Peter McCullough for his views on COVID-19. Sen. Johnson invited Dr. Baron to participate in a public forum with Dr. McCullough, and any other medical experts of their choosing, so the public may hear from many sides regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.“It is well last time for the public to hear from many sides regarding COVID-19 in a public forum.  The purpose of this letter is to invite you, members of your Credentials and Certification Committee, and any other medical expert of your choosing to come to Washington and engage in an open and honest interchange regarding all aspects of COVID-19, without the threat of reprisal by the ABIM or any other organization.,” said the senator.Dr. Peter McCullough, a leading medical expert on COVID-19 spread and vaccination, provided testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs in November 2020 and joined Sen. Johnson’s COVID-19: A Second Opinion panel in January 2022. Although federal health agency officials and vaccine manufacturers turned down Sen. Johnson’s request to join his “Second Opinion” event, this letter is a third attempt to “hear from many sides regarding COVID-19 in a public forum.”“Unfortunately, the federal health agencies, public health experts and vaccine manufacturers did not accept my invitation to either event.   Rather than engage in a public dialogue in which information and perspectives can be openly exchanged and debated, the individuals and organizations responsible for our pandemic response continue to attack and discredit those with a different perspective by using the vague pejorative of  ‘spreading misinformation,’” said the senator.The full text of the letter can be found here and below.June 15, 2022Dr. Richard J. BaronPresident & CEOAmerican Board of Internal Medicine Dear Dr. Baron:I am in receipt of your letter to Dr. Peter McCullough, dated May 26, 2022, in which the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) provided notice that the ABIM’s Credentials and Certification Committee will hold a meeting to determine “whether to recommend any disciplinary sanction against” Dr. McCullough. In your letter, you cite a number of evidence-based public opinions Dr. McCullough made regarding COVID-19, natural and herd immunity, asymptomatic spread, and COVID-19 vaccination policy.   As you are aware, Dr. McCullough provided testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on November 19, 2020, and again on January 24, 2022 during a roundtable event I held in Washington, D.C. titled, “COVID-19, A Second Opinion.”[1]The “Second Opinion” event featured a number of prominent medical experts who happen to have varied perspectives on our response to the pandemic.[2]   In America, different perspectives and diversity of opinions are protected under our Constitution and in a time of crisis, encouraged.  As a Senator charged with the responsibility of conducting oversight of federal government agencies, I asked these medical experts to publicly offer their opinions organized around the “four pillars of pandemic response” as originally published by Dr. McCullough.[3]   In order to have a balanced conversation, I invited the heads or other representatives of our federal health agencies and vaccine manufacturers to present their perspective and engage in a dialogue with Dr McCullough, et al. I also invited those same health agency and manufacturer representatives to an event I held on November 2, 2021 featuring medical experts and individuals with vaccine injuries.[4] Unfortunately, the federal health agencies, public health experts and vaccine manufacturers did not accept my invitation to either event.   Rather than engage in a public dialogue in which information and perspectives can be openly exchanged and debated, the individuals and organizations responsible for our pandemic response continue to attack and discredit those with a different perspective by using the vague pejorative of “spreading misinformation”. It is well last time for the public to hear from many sides regarding COVID-19 in a public forum.  The purpose of this letter is to invite you, members of your Credentials and Certification Committee, and any other medical expert of your choosing to come to Washington and engage in an open and honest interchange regarding all aspects of COVID-19, without the threat of reprisal by the ABIM or any other organization.  I request your participation in a public forum on one of the following dates: July 26, July 27, July 29, August 2 or August 3.Dr. McCullough will be given the same opportunity to name a panel of experts to represent diverse evidence-based viewpoints.  I sincerely hope you will respond positively to this invitation so that we can agree on and schedule a date for this important discussion. Thank you for your attention to this important matter and I look forward to your participation in the upcoming event. Sincerely,###[1] Early Outpatient Treatment: An Essential Part of a COVID-19 Solution, Nov. 19, 2020, https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/early-outpatient-treatment-an-essential-part-of-a-covid-19-solution; COVID-19: A Second Opinion, Rumble, Jan. 24, 2022, https://rumble.com/vt62y6-covid-19-a-secondopinionHtml.[2] Id.[3] McCullough PA, Alexander PE, Armstrong R, Arvinte C, Bain AF, Bartlett RP, Berkowitz RL, Berry AC, Borody TJ, Brewer JH, Brufsky AM, Clarke T, Derwand R, Eck A, Eck J, Eisner RA, Fareed GC, Farella A, Fonseca SNS, Geyer CE Jr, Gonnering RS, Graves KE, Gross KBV, Hazan S, Held KS, Hight HT, Immanuel S, Jacobs MM, Ladapo JA, Lee LH, Littell J, Lozano I, Mangat HS, Marble B, McKinnon JE, Merritt LD, Orient JM, Oskoui R, Pompan DC, Procter BC, Prodromos C, Rajter JC, Rajter JJ, Ram CVS, Rios SS, Risch HA, Robb MJA, Rutherford M, Scholz M, Singleton MM, Tumlin JA, Tyson BM, Urso RG, Victory K, Vliet EL, Wax CM, Wolkoff AG, Wooll V, Zelenko V.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-hsgac-republicans-demand-hearing-on-disinformation-governance-board,"WASHINGTON – On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and five of their Republican colleagues in a letter to Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, requesting a hearing with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas regarding his misleading testimony about the Department of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board before the Committee on May 4, 2022. Recent documents obtained by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) appear to contradict the Secretary’s sworn testimony before the Committee on the nature and scope of the Disinformation Governance Board. The senators are calling for the Chairman of the Committee to provide the oversight and transparency the American public deserves.“We write to request you convene a hearing with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as possible to answer critical questions about apparently misleading testimony before the Committee on May 4 on the Department of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board (the Board). We are deeply concerned that documents recently obtained by Senators Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley contradict the Secretary’s testimony and public statements about the Board. The American public deserves transparency and honest answers to important questions about the true nature and purpose of the Disinformation Governance Board and it is clear that Secretary Mayorkas has not provided them—to the public or this Committee. Therefore, we request you hold a hearing with Secretary Mayorkas and join us in insisting that all records related to the Board be provided to the Committee prior to the hearing,” wrote the senators.Sens. Johnson and Portman are joined on the letter by Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)The full letter can be found here and below.Dear Mr. Chairman:We write to request you convene a hearing with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as possible to answer critical questions about apparently misleading testimony before the Committee on May 4 on the Department of Homeland Security Disinformation Governance Board (the Board). We are deeply concerned that documents recently obtained by Senators Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley contradict the Secretary’s testimony and public statements about the Board.At the May 4 hearing, Secretary Mayorkas testified that the Board “has not yet begun its work.” Yet the documents indicate the Secretary had stood up the Board on February 24, 2022—more than two months earlier. The Board’s charter, signed by the Secretary, required the Board meet “regularly” and “no less than once per quarter.” Another document dated only six days before Secretary Mayorkas appeared before the Committee provides preparatory materials for a meeting between Under Secretary for Policy Robert Silvers and Twitter. The document was prepared by Ms. Nina Jankowicz in her capacity as “Executive Director DHS Disinformation Governance Board,” clearly evidencing that the Board had already begun its work.Based on the documents received, Secretary Mayorkas also misrepresented the nature and scope of the Board in his testimony and public statements. Responding to a question from a reporter “Will American citizens be monitored?” Secretary Mayorkas responded unequivocally “No,” adding that “We at the Department of Homeland Security don’t monitor American citizens.” He went on to suggest the Board would be concentrating on foreign threats—“addressing the threat of disinformation from foreign state adversaries [and] from the cartels.” Yet talking points prepared by Ms. Jankowicz, the Board’s then–Executive Director appear to show that the Department does in fact monitor American citizens and that the Board’s work is concentrated on domestic threats. She writes that the Board’s initial work plan includes working with “industry on countering MDM [mis-, dis-, or mal-information] related to domestic violent extremism” further noting that the Department recently established a “domestic terrorism branch” within the Department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis—the Department’s office responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence. A September 13, 2021, memorandum from Under Secretary Silvers recommending the establishment of the disinformation board also lists several other categories of domestic homeland security disinformation that the board could address including “conspiracy theories about the validity and security of elections,” and domestic violent extremism. In a related example at the May 4 hearing, Senator Rand Paul questioned Secretary Mayorkas saying “I said a million times that masks don’t work . . . You’re going to take that down?”  Secretary Mayorkas responded, “it’s not for us to take that down . . . we are not the public health experts to make that determination.”  Yet in the above referenced memorandum to the Secretary, Under Secretary Silvers lists “disinformation related to the origins and effects of COVID-19 vaccines or the efficacy of masks” as the second example of homeland security disinformation the Board would be established to coordinate efforts to counter.We are also troubled that Secretary Mayorkas failed to provide these documents to the Committee. But for the actions of a whistleblower, it is unlikely any of this information would have come to light. The Secretary failed to provide the Committee these key documents despite a request from Senator Hawley to Secretary Mayorkas at the May 4 hearing that the Secretary provide the Committee with “documents pertaining to the board” and the Secretary’s assurances that “we owe you documents with respect to the work of this board that are already in existence” and that “we will produce the documents that you have requested unless there is a legal prohibition from us doing so.” The American public deserves transparency and honest answers to important questions about the true nature and purpose of the Disinformation Governance board and it is clear that Secretary Mayorkas has not provided them—to the public or this Committee. Therefore, we request you hold a hearing with Secretary Mayorkas and join us in insisting that all records related to the Board be provided to the Committee prior to the hearing.Sincerely,###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) sent a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough highlighting first-hand accounts from VA employees who fear the Biden administration’s coercive COVID-19 vaccine mandates will exacerbate VA workforce shortages and potentially limit care for veterans.“On May 27, 2022, I met with a group of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees regarding their concerns with the quality of care received by veterans.  These health care professionals described the significant workforce shortages at the VA facilities in Wisconsin and Michigan and that the vaccine mandate is only exacerbating these shortages.  The VA owes the public and our veterans answers about the steps the Department is taking to address the workforce issues and to provide the highest quality care to the finest among us,” the senator wrote.Sen. Johnson enclosed five testimonials from Wisconsin and Michigan VA employees for Secretary McDonough to review.The senator also presented whistleblower data he recently obtained demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines’ ability to prevent infection.  “Based on whistleblower data from the Milwaukee VAMC facility dashboard census count between October 22, 2021 and March 8, 2022, for 31 of the 54 days I received daily reports, at least 80 percent of VA employees who tested positive for COVID-19 were vaccinated. For 8 of those 54 days, 100 percent of VA employees who tested positive for COVID-19 were vaccinated,” the senator wrote.“The continuation of care for our veterans should be our top priority, not politically motivated policies like vaccine mandates,” the senator concluded.The letter, testimonials and data can be found here, and the full text of the letter is below. June 13, 2022The Honorable Denis R. McDonough                                                      SecretaryU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Dear Secretary McDonough: On May 27, 2022, I met with a group of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees regarding their concerns with the quality of care received by veterans.  These health care professionals described the significant workforce shortages at the VA facilities in Wisconsin and Michigan and that the vaccine mandate is only exacerbating these shortages.  The VA owes the public and our veterans answers about the steps the Department is taking to address the workforce issues and to provide the highest quality care to the finest among us.On July 26, 2021, you announced that COVID-19 vaccines would be mandatory for VA employees.[1]  You stated that the “VA is taking this necessary step to keep the Veterans it serves safe.”[2]  You continued, “[w]henever a Veteran or VA employee sets foot in a VA facility, they deserve to know that we have done everything in our power to protect them from COVID-19.  With this mandate, we can once again make—and keep—that fundamental promise.”[3]  However, after speaking with VA health care personnel, it does not appear that the vaccine mandate is protecting veterans or VA employees from COVID-19.  These dedicated professionals described how they cared for our veterans during the entirety of the pandemic when proper safety equipment was not available.  The VA employees shared how the VA has now deemed their workplaces “high risk” and require vaccination in order to carry out their jobs.  One nurse stated, “[w]hen [personal protective equipment] was sparse, when COVID surges hit our facility multiple times, there was no concern for my vaccination status.”  The nurse also stated it is “abundantly clear that the vaccine is being used to fit an agenda, not safety.”  Most importantly, these health care professionals shared their concern that the Biden administration cares more about mandating vaccines for VA employees regardless of whether it comes at the cost of those employees’ jobs or potentially limiting care for veterans.  In order for you to understand the impact of the policies you have implemented, I hope you will take the time to read the enclosed testimonials of VA health care professionals from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Iron Mountain, Michigan.In addition to these testimonials, enclosed data from the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee (Milwaukee VAMC) reveals the failure of the vaccine mandate to protect VA employees and veterans from COVID-19.  Based on whistleblower data from the Milwaukee VAMC facility dashboard census count between October 22, 2021 and March 8, 2022, for 31 of the 54 days I received daily reports, at least 80 percent of VA employees who tested positive for COVID-19 were vaccinated.[4]  For 8 of those 54 days, 100 percent of VA employees who tested positive for COVID-19 were vaccinated.[5]Although this data is only from one Wisconsin VA facility, it demonstrates the futility of a vaccine mandate.  The COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent transmission and therefore, a vaccine mandate is pointless.  However, the Biden administration refuses to reevaluate the costs and benefits, or the unintended consequences of vaccine mandates.  An analysis recently published in the BMJ Global Health journal found that “mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policies have had damaging effects on public trust, vaccine confidence, political polarization, human rights, inequities and social wellbeing.”[6]  The authors of that analysis added, “[w]e question the effectiveness and consequences of coercive vaccination policy in pandemic response and urge the research community and policymakers to return to non-discriminatory, trust-based public health approaches.”[7]The VA employees I met with are concerned that the Biden administration’s rigid position on the vaccine mandate will harm the veterans they care for.  The VA already faced significant workforce issues prior to the mandate.[8]  With the mandate in place, as many as 11 percent of the VA workforce may be at risk of disciplinary action, reassignment or losing their jobs.[9]The continuation of care for our veterans should be our top priority, not politically motivated policies like vaccine mandates.  In an effort to provide transparency to the American people regarding the VA’s vaccine mandate, please provide the following information:Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than June 27, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter. ###[1] See Press Release, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Jul. 26, 2021, available at  https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5696#:~:text=VA%20is%20taking%20this%20necessary,the%20country%2C%E2%80%9D%20McDonough%20said.[2] Id.[3] Id.[4] The facility dashboard data provided by the whistleblower and data charts based on that information are enclosed.[5] Id.[6] Bardosh, K., Figueiredo, A. de, Gur-Arie, R., Jamrozik, E., Doidge, J., Lemmens, T., Keshavjee, S., Graham, J.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-joins-sen-rick-scott-colleagues-in-continued-call-for-answers-on-border-crisis,"WASHINGTON – On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), U.S. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and 35 of their colleagues in sending a letter to the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reiterate their call for a comprehensive review of the decisions by the Biden administration that have led to the worst border crisis in United States history. Since sending their initial letter in January, the border crisis has only worsened.“Multiple sources have confirmed to Congress that the Biden administration was warned by career professionals that the rapid implementation of several border and immigration policies would lead to a predictable surge at the border. Our concern is that the Biden administration proceeded to implement these policies despite the harm they would cause to our border and immigration system.  Moreover, the Biden administration did not take adequate steps to prepare for the resulting surge and as a result, a humanitarian crisis has developed,” said the members.“Since our letter was sent, the situation at the border has only become worse. In April 2022, DHS reported 234,088 apprehensions at the southern border, which is the highest number recorded for a single month in over twenty years,” continued the members.Read more about the letter in Fox News.The full text of the letter can be found here or below.June 9, 2022The Honorable Joseph V. CuffariInspector GeneralOffice of Inspector GeneralU.S. Department of Homeland Security Dear Dr. Cuffari:Thank you for your March 17, 2022, response to our January 20, 2022, letter requesting a comprehensive investigation into the worst border crisis in United States’ history.[1] We write to reiterate our request for an investigation and that you provide details on what you have learned from your audits and investigation so far. As you know, this was a bicameral request signed by 107 Members of Congress, which is the largest cohort of Members to make a request of you this Congress.As our letter stated, there is recent precedent for your office taking up a comprehensive investigation based on a request from several Members of Congress in the minority party. In January 2017, 41 Members of Congress in the minority party requested the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct Executive Order #13769, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.”[2] On January 18, 2018, your office issued a 113-page report in which you obtained email correspondence and documents from the DHS headquarters, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis to conduct your investigation.[3] In addition, your report stated that you interviewed over 160 individuals and reviewed over 48,000 documents before coming to a conclusion.[4]As the Department’s Inspector General, you have the unique position to help improve the crisis at our southern border. We entrust you and your office to provide “independent oversight and promote excellence, integrity, and accountability within DHS.”[5] In doing so, the OIG is tasked with investigating allegations relating to fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and both criminal and non-criminal violations of laws negatively impacting DHS’ mission.[6] In our original letter, we provided ample evidence of mismanagement at the highest levels of the department, including statutes routinely ignored in favor of ambiguous policy directives. Specifically, our letter stated:Multiple sources have confirmed to Congress that the Biden administration was warned by career professionals that the rapid implementation of several border and immigration policies would lead to a predictable surge at the border. Our concern is that the Biden administration proceeded to implement these policies despite the harm they would cause to our border and immigration system.  Moreover, the Biden administration did not take adequate steps to prepare for the resulting surge and as a result, a humanitarian crisis has developed.[7]Further, in your office’s strategic plan, you state that you will focus on oversight of high-risk and mission-critical areas and emerging threats, while responding to Congressional mandates and requests.[8] America is facing the worst border crisis in our history, and Congress has directly asked for your assistance and expertise.Therefore, we once again request a comprehensive investigation of the crisis on our southern border. Since our letter was sent, the situation at the border has only become worse. In April 2022, DHS reported 234,088 apprehensions at the southern border, which is the highest number recorded for a single month in over twenty years.[9] Members of Congress and the American people look forward to your comprehensive investigation into what has caused this crisis in order to prevent it from ever happening again.We appreciate your attention to this serious matter, and we look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely,###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), U.S. Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.), U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and 18 of their colleagues in a letter calling for answers from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) panel regarding the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in children under the age of five. The VRBPAC panel will meet on June 15 to consider the authorization of the vaccine for emergency use.“The broad approach of the CDC and FDA to date has been a one-size fits all policy – get the vaccine regardless of age, risk factors, the underlying health of the individual, or previous infection. Yet, to date there remain many unanswered questions about these EUA-approved COVID-19 vaccines and only a small percentage of the safety data about these vaccines that are in the possession of the FDA and the manufacturers has been released for review,” said the senators.“We believe it is prudent and necessary that the FDA provide answers to a number of questions before approving EUA vaccines for children under age 5, including more than 70% of whom are already seropositive for COVID-19,” continued the senators.A few of the questions asked by the bicameral group of legislators are:Sens.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-joins-sen-moran-colleagues-in-demanding-answers-from-doj-on-efforts-to-protect-pro-life-groups-from-violence,"WASHINGTON – On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and 14 of their Republican colleagues in a letter calling on U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate and work to prevent violence against pro-life organizations. After a draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was leaked to the media, pro-life and religious organizations have been increasingly vandalized and damaged, including the politically-motivated attack on the Wisconsin Family Action office in Madison, Wisconsin.In May 2022, Sen. Johnson sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Christopher Wray, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas asking why the attack on the Wisconsin Family Action office has not been labeled “domestic terrorism.” Jane’s Revenge, a pro-abortion group, threw two Molotov cocktails into the Wisconsin Family Action office and painted “if abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either” on their building. Following the attack, President Biden made no public remarks and refused to condemn the attack. To date, DOJ, FBI and DHS have yet to respond to Sen. Johnson’s letter.“We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats,” the senators wrote.“The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values. We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate,” the senators continued.Sens. Johnson and Jerry Moran were joined on the letter by Senators Steve Daines (Mont.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), John Boozman (Ark.), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), James Risch (Idaho), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), Ted Cruz (Texas), John Thune (S.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), James Lankford (Okla.) and Mike Braun (Ind.).The full letter can be found here or below.June 7, 2022 The Honorable Merrick GarlandAttorney GeneralU.S. Department of Justice Dear Attorney General Garland:We write to request information about how the Department of Justice is addressing the disturbing trend of harassment, intimidation, and violence against religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion in the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. While churches and crisis pregnancy centers have been vandalized, pro-life offices in Oregon and Wisconsin have been targeted by arsonists.  We are deeply concerned that this trend will continue should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in the coming weeks unless the Department of Justice, the FBI, and U.S. Attorneys’ Offices take a firm public stance and proactive response against these violent threats.Last October, the Department of Justice wasted no time in publicly responding to threats of violence against educators and school administrators related to COVID-19 policies. You issued a memo in which you stated, “While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views.”  At the same time, the Department created specialized training and guidance for local school boards and school administrators to help “potential victims understand the type of behavior that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.”  The Department also took steps to improve coordination between the FBI, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and local law enforcement to “open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response.”Yet in comparison to the current climate, in which multiple acts—not just threats—of violence have been documented, we have not seen the commensurate public response from the Department of Justice that the moment demands. The criminal acts perpetrated against those who oppose legalized abortion are a clear effort to intimidate or coerce individuals who hold pro-life values. We call on the Department of Justice to take these actions seriously and work to prevent violence and, when such acts are perpetrated, investigate and prosecute them as appropriate.We are dismayed that the open and public urgency with which the Department of Justice undertook efforts in the name of public safety last year is not being replicated currently to protect religious and other pro-life organizations and individuals. We seek answers to the following questions:The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs is imminent, and thus we ask for a response to these questions by June 10, 2022.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/6/sen-johnson-on-5-gas-prices-in-wisconsin-joe-biden-caused-this-and-it-s-hurting-americans,"WASHINGTON—On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Fox News’ “The Story with Martha MacCallum” and Fox Business’ “Kudlow” to discuss how President Biden’s war on fossil fuels and American energy independence has increased gas and energy prices.The interviews can be found here and here. Excerpts are below.“I think in Wisconsin, we got some gas stations now reporting over $5 a gallon. I haven't paid that much yet. But people are filling up their pickup trucks and paying, you know, it's costing them over $100. That's when they can afford to fill up their truck or their car. So this is putting a huge pinch on consumers, particularly seniors on a fixed income and people at the lower end of the economic spectrum. That's who it really hurts. Doesn't hurt Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and the big tech social media giants or, you know, the elite Democrats that support President Biden's environmental policies. This is hurting real people.” (Sen. Ron Johnson, ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum,’ 6/6/2022)“Well, my first question is, how can his approval ratings be that high? How can there be 28% of the American population that actually approve of what's happening in this country? But, you know, when I talk to people at the gas station, I mean, they are upset. They're outraged. This, you know, it's costing them more than $100 to fill up their truck. And that's when they can fill up the tank. A lot of them can only put in 40 bucks worth. And that's not even half a tank in some cases. So people are really noticing it. They're going the grocery store, they know that they're not getting what they used to be able to buy because inflation's pushing up food prices. But gasoline that is the one that, really, everybody sees what the price per gallon is in Wisconsin. Now, we've had some of the first gas stations top over $5 a gallon. Again, this is completely out of control and people are noticing it.” (Sen. Ron Johnson, ‘Kudlow,’ 6/6/2022)“And of course it didn't just happen. This is actually caused by President Biden. The radical members of his administration and their neighbors in Congress, this is their policies. This is what they want to happen. When you engage in a war on fossil fuel, when you restrict the supply of it for, you know, in a number of different ways, you know, you cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, you make it more difficult to permit, you have your allies and outside environmental groups to file lawsuits against people producing fossil fuels. You're going to reduce the supply of it, which is going to automatically increase the price. They know the basic laws of supply and demand. This is the result of their policies. This is what they wanted. They just don't want to be held accountable for it.” (Sen. Ron Johnson, ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum,’ 6/6/2022)###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and 46 of their Republican colleagues in a letter to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, pledging to block any legislation that would undermine any existing pro-life protections or weaken the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding for abortion.“We write to express our unwavering support for the Hyde Amendment and all other longstanding pro-life protections. For more than 45 years, the Hyde Amendment has ensured that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions, saving the lives of nearly 2.5 million preborn children. As you know, the Hyde Amendment is supported by both a substantial majority of the American public and a bipartisan majority of sitting United States Senators, and was most recently signed into law by President Biden…” the senators wrote.“On February 5, 2021, we wrote to you that ‘[w]e are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.’ We firmly renew this commitment for FY 2023,” the senators continued.“We urge you to start where we finished by making a baseline commitment to maintain the same pro-life protections that were included in [FY22 Appropriations], and to eschew any taxpayer-funded giveaways that benefit the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry,” the senators concluded.Sens.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and other Republican members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) in a letter to Acting Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Lawrence Tabak, requesting information on disclosures of royalty payments made by third-party providers to NIH employees.This letter comes after the nonprofit organization Open the Books submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to disclose royalty payments made between 2009 and 2020. The agency only provided the names of the employees receiving the payments and the number of payments they received between 2009 and 2014; the amounts of the individual payments, the innovation in question, and the names of the third-party payers were redacted by NIH. These FOIA redactions contradict a previous NIH statement claiming an entity “would have to make a request via the Freedom of Information Act to find out royalty payments to individual researchers.”“In 2005, the NIH implemented a policy requiring its employees to disclose royalty payments on the consent forms for clinical trial participants; however, the agency has taken no action to disclose such payments to the public at large. Nevertheless, we believe that the American taxpayer deserves to know the degree to which government doctors and researchers have a financial interest in drugs and products they support, and whether any relationship exists between federal grants awarded by NIH and royalty payments received by NIH personnel. Additionally, Americans deserve greater transparency in how the hundreds of millions in royalty payments NIH receives are distributed, and the degree to which NIH's leadership- already among the highest-paid individuals in the federal bureaucracy - has benefited from this ""hidden"" revenue stream,” the senators wrote.Under 5 U.S.C. § 2954, ""[a]n Executive agency, on request of the Committee on [Oversight and Reform] of the House of Representatives, or of any seven members thereof, or on request of the Committee on [Homeland Security and] Governmental Affairs of the Senate, or any five members thereof, shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.""In order to fulfill this oversight mandate, the Senators asked that the NIH respond and provide the requested information no later than 5:00PM on Friday, June 17, 2022.Sen. Johnson and Sen. Paul were joined on the letter by Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and James Lankford (R-Okla.).The full text of the letter can be found here and below. The Honorable Lawrence A. TabakActing Director of the National Institutes of HealthNational Institutes of Health Dear Acting Director Tabak:As members of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 2954 as detailed below, we the undersigned write today to request information from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding the disclosure of royalty payments made by third-party providers to NIH employees.Each year, NIH awards tens of billions of dollars in the form of federal grants, and under §401.10 of the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments (Bayh-Dole) Act[1], federal agencies and employees may receive royalty payments for products and inventions when listed as an inventor or “co-inventor” on a product’s patent. A 2020 study[2] conducted by the Government Accountability Office showed that, in total, 93 NIH patents contributed to 34 FDA-approved prescription drugs, generating roughly $2 billion in royalty payments to the agency between 1991-2019. In 2004 alone, some 900 NIH scientists earned approximately $8.9 million in royalties for drugs and inventions they discovered while working for the government.[3] In 2005, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a policy[4] requiring its employees to disclose these royalty payments on the consent forms for clinical trial participants; however, the agency has taken no action to disclose such payments to the public at large. In fact, even after the nonprofit organization Open the Books submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to disclose royalty payments made between 2009 and 2020, the agency only provided the names of the employees receiving the payments and the number of payments they received between 2009 and 2014; the amounts of the individual payments, the innovation in question, and the names of the third-party payers were redacted by NIH.[5]  These FOIA redactions contradict a 2005 statement by an NIH spokesman that an entity “would have to make a request via the Freedom of Information Act to find out royalty payments to individual researchers.”[6] Nevertheless, we believe that the American taxpayer deserves to know 1) the degree to which government doctors and researchers have a financial interest in drugs and products they support, and 2) whether any relationship exists between federal grants awarded by NIH and royalty payments received by NIH personnel. Additionally, Americans deserve greater transparency in how the hundreds of millions in royalty payments NIH receives are distributed, and the degree to which NIH’s leadership – already among the highest-paid individuals in the federal bureaucracy – has benefited from this “hidden” revenue stream.The U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is charged with studying:The efficiency and economy of operations of all branches of the Government including the possible existence of fraud, misfeasance, malfeasance, collusion, mismanagement, incompetence, corruption or unethical practices, waste, extravagance, conflicts of interest, and the improper expenditure of Government funds in transactions, contracts, and activities of the Government or of Government officials and employees and any and all such improper practices between Government personnel and corporations, individuals, companies, or persons afflicted therewith, doing business with the Government, and the compliance or noncompliance of such corporations, companies, or individuals or other entities with the rules, regulations, and laws governing the various governmental agencies and the Government’s relationship with the public.[7]Accordingly, as members of that committee, and in order to fulfill this oversight mandate, we request the following information:4.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/wsj-sen-johnson-plots-a-return-to-economic-sanity,"OSHKOSH – On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal published a letter to the editor by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) detailing the actions needed to build a stable economic future in America and highlighting the economic failures of the Biden administration.The full letter can be found here and excerpts are below.“It starts with safety and security. We must secure our border and dramatically reduce the flow of illegal immigration by reinstating consequences for illegal entry. The credible-fear standard, which has caused “catch and release” and the massive increase in illegal entries, must be raised closer to the stricter asylum requirements. Asylum claims must be adjudicated rapidly and definitively. Once we control our border, we should establish a legal immigration system that can provide the workers our economy needs without depressing wages.“We need to stop fueling inflation with deficit spending, which should be cut drastically. We can lower gasoline and energy prices by allowing the private sector to extract the fossil fuels we need to power our economy. I support an all-of-the-above energy strategy, but it must be market-based and capable of meeting growing demand.“Our tax system must remain competitive with low rates to encourage work, entrepreneurship and innovation. In addressing the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire in 2026, let’s design a simpler and more rational tax system that can stand the test of time.…“Businesses should focus on providing high-quality products at competitive prices with excellent service. Unnecessary regulations distract from those priorities at enormous cost. The U.S. regulatory burden is over $2 trillion a year—to which the Biden administration added $200 billion in its first year. Eliminating unnecessary regulations would lower the cost of products and free businesses to innovate.“The pandemic exposed supply-chain vulnerabilities. Too many corporations forgot the basics: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. But the solution isn’t to “reshore” all manufacturing. Facing what will probably be a significant long-term labor shortage, it makes no sense to manufacture high-labor-content products here. Instead, bring back vital strategic products and do better at global site diversification.”###"

It passed our committee unanimously, twice. It's a good idea and could save lives.

It is named after Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, two students killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack on February 14, 2018 in Parkland, Florida.It is just sad that this body can't pass this bill when about a month ago, they passed an identical bill that applied to churches. This one applies to schools, and yet it's inappropriate, according to the Majority Leader, to pass this non-partisan bill by unanimous consent.This week I introduced the ""No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act"" to require that any convention or agreement resulting from the work of the World Health Organization's (WHO) intergovernmental negotiating body be deemed a treaty, requiring the advice and consent of a supermajority of the Senate.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-introduces-legislation-to-protect-american-sovereignty-against-world-health-organization,"WASHINGTON – On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) introduced the “No WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty Without Senate Approval Act” to require that any convention or agreement resulting from the work of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) intergovernmental negotiating body be deemed a treaty, requiring the advice and consent of a supermajority of the Senate. The legislation comes as the WHO pushes for broad new powers under a new “international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.”After the Biden Administration’s failed COVID-19 response and the WHO’s mismanagement of the pandemic, Americans remain skeptical of continuing infringements on personal liberties and freedoms. The legislation would provide more transparency in WHO agreements and a constitutional check on the administration.“The WHO, along with our federal health agencies, failed miserably in its response to COVID-19. It’s failure should not be rewarded with a new international treaty that would increase its power at the expense of American sovereignty. What WHO does need is greater accountability and transparency. This bill makes clear to the Biden administration that any new WHO pandemic agreement must be deemed a treaty and submitted to the Senate for ratification. The sovereignty of the United States is not negotiable,” said Sen. Johnson.“The WHO is a corrupt organization that is supposed to support international health, but instead it caves to tyrannical regimes and plays politics. The constitution is clear – any international treaty requires the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. I am proud to join my colleagues in ensuring the WHO cannot dictate health policy in America,” said Sen. Rubio.“The World Health Organization has completely failed the American people and the world by working hand in hand with the Chinese Communist Party to conceal the origins of COVID-19. The United States should not, under any circumstances, choose to relinquish American sovereignty and public health decisions to an organization controlled by Beijing. That’s common sense. I’m proud to join Senator Johnson and our colleagues on this bill to keep Americans’ public health choices in the hands of the American people,” said Sen. Rick Scott.“Throughout the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) showed a lack of good governance, transparency and independence. For years, I have raised concerns about the systematic problems and inability of the WHO to make real reforms. Our bill would require any WHO pandemic-related agreement to be reviewed and ratified by the Senate. The Senate must weigh in on a topic of such critical importance before binding the United States,” said Sen. Barrasso.“In the course of this pandemic, the World Health Organization lost trust with many. I’ve pressed the World Health Organization for answers on its initial response, questioning its reliance on manipulated Chinese Communist Party health data, and abetting China. Given the Biden administration’s support for expanding the WHO’s responsibilities and the continued Chinese Communist Party influence over the WHO, it is important Congress plays its constitutional role in evaluating any potential treaty-like agreement,” said Sen. Grassley.“This legislation would classify any new WHO pandemic convention or agreement as a treaty, ensuring that it is reviewed by the Senate and subject to approval of two-thirds of the Senate in order to be ratified. This will make sure that there is proper oversight of the administration’s actions at the WHO and help us maintain U.S. sovereignty,” said Sen. Hoeven.“Actions by the WHO over the past two years, particularly in terms of the pandemic and abortion, raise serious questions about whether it operates as a truly independent body that ultimately benefits the American people.  I know many Mississippians are vexed that the Congress can’t act to stop some of the egregious decisions coming out of the WHO. In representing the American people, the Senate should have a role in determining whether our nation should be subjected to its biased or more controversial actions,” said Sen. Hyde-Smith.“I refuse to cede America’s sovereignty on managing public health crises to the corrupt and inept WHO. Montanans did not elect the WHO to represent them in any level of government – I am glad to support this bill to prevent an international organization from possessing power over the American people,” said Sen. Daines.“Because the Biden Administration has failed to hold the World Health Organization accountable and root out the Chinese Communist Party’s malign influence on the WHO, Congress must step up and defend American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests. This important bill would uphold the U.S. Constitution and require the Senate’s advice and consent to ratification on any convention, agreement, or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response reached by the World Health Assembly’s so-called International Negotiating Body,” said Sen. Hagerty.Sen. Johnson is joined on the bill by Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).Read more about the bill in the Daily Caller.The full text of the bill can be found here.###"

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-ron-johnson-s-school-safety-legislation-blocked-by-senate-democrats,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) delivered remarks on the Senate floor about his legislation, the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, and asked for unanimous consent for its passage.The bill would codify into law a clearinghouse of information for the best school safety practices. The clearinghouse, available at SchoolSafety.gov, informs parents, teachers and school officials of the best practices for improving school security and publishes information on available grant programs and federal resources. It is named after Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, two students killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack on February 14, 2018 in Parkland, Florida. Sen. Johnson introduced the legislation in November 2019 with Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.)Following Sen. Johnson’s remarks on Wednesday, Sen. Schumer (D-N.Y.) blocked the passage of the bill. Click here for the video The Senator delivered the following remarks:“Madam President, today America grieves. There's nothing partisan about it. Being a parent and grandparent, I cannot imagine the grief felt by the parents of those children. Unless you've experienced it, none of us can. What's the solution? There is no “one” solution. Let's be honest about that. “Following Sandy Hook, following Parkland, I met with the parents of those horrific and senseless tragedies I've been blessed to get to know three parents quite well – Tom and Gina Hoyer and Max Schachter. Tom and Gena are the parents of Luke Hoyer. Max is the father of Alex Schachter. To the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School slaughter in Parkland, Florida that occurred on February 14, 2018 – in getting to know Tom, Gina and Max, you get some sense of the level of grief.“I mentioned, there's nothing partisan about the grief.  I listened to President Biden's remarks last night. I think the point he made that pierced my heart, because President Biden has known tragedy, is when he said that those parents in Texas, they're asking themselves, will they ever sleep again? We all grieve. We're all looking for solutions. The good senator from Delaware said, we must take action,“What I’ve always valued about Tom and Gena and Max is these are three individuals, parents, who do know the pain. They still grieve for the loss of their sons, and yet they have not approached trying to find solutions in any partisan way whatsoever. They're trying to find areas of agreement. They advised the Federal Commission on School Safety. They came up with a pretty common sense action. It may not solve all the problems, but it's a good idea. It is such a good idea that as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we codified it. We passed it unanimously out of our committee in November of 2019.“It's called the Luke and Alex School Safety Act. It's pretty simple. It just creates a clearinghouse of information of the best practices for school safety. It involves numerous departments - Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security. They all must approve what these best practices are. It ensures that parents, teachers, school officials and other stakeholders have input into what those best practices are. It doesn't allow the clearinghouse to mandate any school to take any certain action. Maybe most importantly, it publishes the available grant programs and federal resources available for school safety.  Again, it passed out of the Committee on Homeland Security Governmental Affairs twice, unanimously – once under my chairmanship, once under the chairmanship of Senator Peters.“There's nothing partisan about this bill whatsoever. It's just a good idea that could save lives. It was such a good idea, that under the previous administration, they set up that clearinghouse. It's up and it's operating. So all this bill does at this point is serve as a model for what's happening. All this bill does now is codify it to make sure this clearinghouse stands the test of time – that it will always be there to provide the best practices on school safety.“Now, I'm very sensitive to the moment in time we’re in right now We should let the nation and those parents grieve. I don't want to politicize anything about this moment.“So I called up Max, Tom and Gena and asked them, what would you like me do? They've been trying to get this codified, passed into law, for four years. I can't explain why it's not law. Just last month, the Senate passed the Pray Safe Act, which basically took the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, and applied it to churches. That passed by unanimous consent. No objection. I tried to attach this bill to that bill, but for whatever reason, somebody is objecting. I have no idea why. None.“Again, it passed our committee unanimously, twice. It's a good idea. It could save lives. It is an action, when people are calling for action following this tragedy.….“I just want to again emphasize the fact that I just spoke with Max and Gena and Tom. These are parents of children who lost their lives in school shootings. These are parents who have come up with a solution, a nonpartisan solution. They got it recommended by the Federal Commission on School Safety. They told me that the day after Parkland a parent from Sandy Hook had a piece of legislation that they'd been trying to get passed but couldn't. They would help. They would have been one hundred percent supportive of that piece of legislation, come to the floor and pass by unanimous consent – irrespective of the timing. “They asked me to come to the floor today, to ask my colleagues to lay aside partisanship, to do something for these families, provide them some measure of comfort by passing a completely nonpartisan bill that could make a difference, that could save a life. There is no reason not to pass this bill today, in this chamber, at this hour. So, Madam President, as in the legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar number 102 S.111. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made, and laid upon the table.…“As Chairman of Homeland Security, I passed over 300 pieces of legislation out of committee. Over 130 of those became law. Very few of those, almost none, were partisan in any way, shape or form. The approach I used to have that kind of legislative success is rather than focus on issues that divide us, I concentrated on areas of agreement. Today I brought to the Senate floor a nonpartisan bill, a bill crafted by the parents, the parents who lost their sons in one of these horrific tragedies. It passed our committee twice, unanimously. Those parents asked me to come today to please pass this bill, take some action, provide some comfort to all the parents that are grieving, to a nation that is grieving. “I came to the floor today, and I will not engage in partisanship, other than to say it is just sad. It is just sad that this body can't pass this bill when about a month ago, they passed an identical bill that applied to churches. This one applies to schools, and yet it's inappropriate, according to the Majority Leader, to pass this non-partisan bill by unanimous consent. Madam President, this is a very sad day for the United States Senate. I yield.”###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-joins-sen-rick-scott-colleagues-in-letter-to-dhs-enforce-the-law-stop-dismantling-legal-immigration-process,"WASHINGTON – On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding information on the Doyle Memorandum and the department’s continued dismantling of the U.S. legal immigration process. The Doyle Memorandum, issued by Principal Legal Advisor Kerry E. Doyle from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of the Principal Legal Advisor on April 3, 2022, advises ICE attorneys to follow new guidance that circumvents established immigration processes and could lead to the mass dismissal of deportation cases before these cases come before a judge. The memorandum comes as President Biden’s failed border policies have created a historic humanitarian and national security crisis at America’s southern border, with more than 2 million illegal crossings in 2021 alone.“Turning a blind eye to willful and continued violations of the immigration laws that your agency is statutorily charged with enforcing is undeniably an abuse of such discretion that will encourage further illegal immigration and embolden criminal aliens already unlawfully present in our communities,” said the senators. The full text of the letter can be found here and below.May 24, 2022 The Honorable Alejandro MayorkasSecretary of Homeland SecurityU.S. Department of Homeland Security Dear Secretary Mayorkas:The crisis created by the Biden administration on the Unites States’ southern border is raging like never before. Not only has President Biden ordered the dismantlement of successful border policies implemented under the last administration, resulting in record-high illegal border crossings in 2021, but deportations under the Biden administration have also dropped to the lowest levels in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) history[1]. During FY 2021, ICE recorded only 59,011 deportations, compared with 185,884 deportations in FY 2020, and 267,258 illegal aliens removed in FY 2019. The Biden administration’s repeated actions to incentivize illegal immigration by refusing to fully enforce our laws and secure our southern border are nothing short of a dereliction of its duty to the American people. As part of our fight to hold this administration accountable for its reckless failure to uphold our nation’s laws and secure the border, we write today in reference to and with grave concern for the April 3, 2022, ICE memorandum directed to all Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) attorneys entitled Guidance to OPLA Attorneys Regarding the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Laws and the Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion (“Doyle Memorandum”). This memorandum alarmingly instructs ICE prosecutors to consider dismissing older cases of illegal aliens who are deemed to not pose public safety threats, rather than continuing enforcement actions against those individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States. This misguided policy prioritizes artificially lowering the backlog of immigration court cases above enforcing our immigration laws enacted by Congress, and represents a gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion. The recently issued Doyle Memorandum will only worsen the already historic and deadly crisis on our southern border. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, the Executive Office for Immigration Review reported a backlog of 1,503,931 pending cases.[2]  Under the guise of exercising “prosecutorial discretion,” the Doyle Memorandum proposes the mass dismissal of these pending deportation cases against aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States and otherwise subject to removal for violating our immigration laws. Turning a blind eye to willful and continued violations of the immigration laws that your agency is statutorily charged with enforcing is undeniably an abuse of such discretion that will encourage further illegal immigration and embolden criminal aliens already unlawfully present in our communities. As members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which is dutifully charged with oversight of your agency, we request the following:                                                               i.      Will “nonpriority” cases include individuals who have been previously deported or removed from the United States?                                                             ii.      Will “nonpriority” cases include individuals who have one or more prior failures to appear at immigration court proceedings, or who have a history of absconding from immigration detention or removal orders?                                                            iii.      Will “nonpriority” cases include individuals who have been convicted of one or more serious misdemeanors or felonies?                                                               i.      Does dismissal or administrative closure confer upon the alien a lawful immigration status?                                                              ii.      Does dismissal or administrative closure prevent a future removal case from being prosecuted against the alien?                                                                i.      Are such individuals required to regularly report to ICE to ensure the agency maintains accurate location and contact information for each individual?                                                             ii.      Are such individuals subject to any geographic restrictions to limit their movements within the United States until they attain a lawful immigration status? Please respond in an expeditious manner, but no later than July 7, 2022.Sincerely, ###"

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland questioning whether Blue Star Strategies, a Democrat lobbying firm, filed incomplete and misleading information with the Department of Justice (DOJ). On May 12, 2022, Blue Star Strategies’ top executives, Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter filed, under penalty of perjury, Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) forms with DOJ regarding the work they did on behalf of their foreign client, Burisma Holdings (Burisma) and the company’s corrupt Russia-aligned owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.Based on the senators’ previous work examining the extent to which Blue Star Strategies met with Obama administration officials on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky, it appears that Blue Star Strategies’ FARA form lacked complete and accurate information.  For example, on its FARA form Blue Star Strategies disclosed that it only had two meetings with Obama administration officials and that its work with respect to Mr. Zlochevsky and Burisma “began and ended in 2016.”Blue Star Strategies’ description of its two meetings, disclosed on its FARA form is copied below: The senators wrote that based on this filing “it appears the date of the meeting with Mr. Hochstein is inconsistent with our investigative records.  Further, Blue Star Strategies’ FARA filing states that its activity with respect to Mr. Zlochevsky and Burisma “began and ended in 2016”; however, our records indicate that the activity began in 2015 and extended several years after 2016.   Accordingly, it appears that Blue Star Strategies failed to disclose several other meetings it arranged with U.S. government officials on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky in its FARA filing.”In fact, the senators noted that “Blue Star Strategies failed to disclose on the FARA form at least nine other meetings it had with U.S. government officials—including two meetings with sitting U.S. ambassadors to Ukraine—regarding Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.” Sens. Johnson and Grassley’s staff’s August 2020 transcribed interviews of Ms. Tramontano and Ms. Painter can be found here and here, respectively.  Errata for the Tramontano and Painter interviews can be found here and here, respectively. The full text of the letter can be found here and below. May 23, 2022The Honorable Merrick GarlandAttorney GeneralDepartment of Justice Dear Attorney General Garland:              In 2020, we examined the extent to which Blue Star Strategies, a Democratic lobbying firm, met with Obama administration officials on behalf of its foreign client, Burisma Holdings (“Burisma”), and the company’s corrupt Russia-aligned owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.[1]  Based on our investigative records and recently published Foreign Agents Registration Act (“FARA”) forms, it appears that Blue Star Strategies’ top executives, Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter, filed incomplete and misleading information with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”).According to FARA filings dated May 12, 2022, Ms. Tramontano and Ms. Painter disclosed under penalty of perjury their meetings with government officials on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.[2]  The form noted that in February 2016, Blue Star Strategies emailed and met with then-State Department official Amos Hochstein to “introduce Mr. Zlochevsky’s attorney so he could present an explanation of the adverse proceedings in the U.K. and Ukraine involving Mr. Zlochevsky.”[3]  The form also indicated that in March 2016, Blue Star Strategies emailed and met with then-Under Secretary of State Catherine Novelli for the same purpose.[4]  However, it appears the date of the meeting with Mr. Hochstein is inconsistent with our investigative records.  Further, Blue Star Strategies’ FARA filing states that its activity with respect to Mr. Zlochevsky and Burisma “began and ended in 2016”; however, our records indicate that the activity began in 2015 and extended several years after 2016.[5]  Accordingly, it appears that Blue Star Strategies failed to disclose several other meetings it arranged with U.S. government officials on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky in its FARA filing.Specifically, Ms. Tramontano wrote to our Committees in December 2019 that Blue Star Strategies had two meetings with Mr. Hochstein regarding Burisma—the first meeting was on December 10, 2015, and the second meeting on March 24, 2016.[6]  Blue Star Strategies failed to disclose these meetings on its FARA form.With respect to the December 2015 meeting, Ms. Tramontano noted that the “initial meeting with Mr. Hochstein was to understand his and the State Department’s position regarding an independent energy company, Burisma.”[7]  In a transcribed interview with our Committees, Ms. Tramontano discussed the December 10, 2015, meeting and described Mr. Hochstein’s view of Burisma as “negative.”[8]  It is unclear why Blue Star Strategies did not disclose this initial meeting with Mr. Hochstein in its FARA form. With respect to the second meeting with Mr. Hochstein, according to our records, Ms. Painter and attorney John Buretta were in attendance.[9]  While it appears that Blue Star Strategies provided an accurate description of the purpose of this meeting on its FARA form, the date of this meeting on the form is inconsistent with the information the firm provided our Committees.  Whereas the FARA form indicates that the meeting between Blue Star Strategies, Mr. Buretta, and Mr. Hochstein occurred in February 2016, Ms. Tramontano and Ms. Painter confirmed to our Committees that this second meeting with Mr. Hochstein occurred on March 24, 2016.[10] In addition, Ms. Tramontano told the Committees that Blue Star Strategies engaged in “government relations assistance” in the United States for Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky.[11]  However, Ms. Painter denied to the Committees that Blue Star Strategies’ activities were “government relations assistance.”[12]  Both Ms. Tramontano and Ms. Painter denied to the Committees that they lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky and denied that they intended to influence U.S. policy with respect to them.[13]  However, Mr. Hochstein’s testimony before the Committees contradicted Ms. Tramontano’s and Ms. Painter’s claims.  When the Committees asked Mr. Hochstein whether he believed Blue Star Strategies intended to “alter or influence U.S policy with respect to Zlochevsky,” he told the Committees, “[t]hey did not like my answer [regarding Mr. Zlochevsky], and they tried to convince me otherwise.”[14]  This example indicates that Blue Star Strategies did, in fact, engage in lobbying efforts on behalf of Burisma and its owner.Based on the evidence in our possession, it appears Blue Star Strategies failed to disclose on the FARA form at least nine other meetings it had with U.S. government officials—including two meetings with sitting U.S. ambassadors to Ukraine—regarding Burisma and Mr. Zlochevsky including the following:[15]DOJ must scrutinize Blue Star Strategies’ recently filed FARA forms given the firm’s apparent incomplete disclosures and its lack of consistency with our investigative records, which are based, in significant part, on Blue Star Strategies’ representations to Congress. Accordingly, we request DOJ provide the following information:Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than June 6, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely, # # #[1] See e.g. S.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sens-johnson-ossoff-call-for-further-action-by-department-of-defense-following-investigation-into-privatized-housing,"WASHINGTON — On Friday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent a joint letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin requesting several new actions in response to the findings of their eight-month bipartisan investigation into the mistreatment of military families in privatized housing.On May 12, Rachel Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy, and Environment announced the Army is undertaking an investigation of Balfour Beatty’s performance at Ft. Gordon, an audit of their property management records, and a suspension of incentive fees as a direct result of PSI’s findings. Assistant Secretary Jacobson also said the Army’s General Counsel initiated a legal review of possible enforcement options, including whether or not the Army can amend contracts with privatized housing operators.In their letter, Chair Ossoff and Ranking Member Johnson called on Secretary Austin to initiate similar reviews by the Navy and Air Force, both of which have installations with private Balfour Beatty housing. They are also calling on the Secretary to provide additional information about other legal authorities or resources the Department of Defense has or needs to improve oversight of privatized military housing companies like Balfour Beatty.“We are concerned that the steps summarized above are not sufficient. Balfour pled guilty to fraud against all three military service branches — the Air Force and the Navy as well as the Army. Further, the information uncovered by PSI’s inquiry and at the April 26th hearing suggests that Balfour has continued to mistreat military families and to record inaccurate and incomplete work order data in its internal Yardi system at non-Army installations,” the senators wrote.PSI’s report found numerous examples of inaccurate work orders and repair requests. Chair Ossoff and Ranking Member Johnson asked Secretary Austin if the Department has current access to all original repair requests, and if not, what steps are needed to ensure they do.In April, Chair Ossoff and Ranking Member Johnson held a hearing revealing the mistreatment of military families in privatized housing in which service members, military spouses, and housing advocates testified, and in which Balfour executives testified under oath about the company’s actions.The full text of the letter can be found here.# # #"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-colleagues-introduce-resolution-in-support-of-finland-sweden-joining-nato,"WASHINGTON – Last week, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined his colleagues in a bipartisan resolution in support of Finland’s and Sweden’s accession to NATO.Sen. Johnson is joined on the resolution by Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Chris Coons (D-Del.).“At a time when Russia is committing war crimes against its neighbor and is engaged in other malign activities in Europe, the expansion of NATO is both justified and imperative. The addition of Finland and Sweden to the alliance will strengthen the alliance and underscores Putin’s strategic blunder in invading Ukraine. He has accomplished exactly the opposite of what he intended,” said Sen. Johnson.“Last week, I was honored to meet President Niinistö of Finland and Prime Minister Andersson of Sweden here at the Capitol. Both Finland and Sweden have been longtime friends and partners to both the United States and to NATO, and I am fully confident that their inclusion will strengthen and add new capabilities to the alliance. To welcome their mutual decision to apply for membership in NATO, something that I have long-encouraged them to do, I’ve introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senator Menendez and others in support of their speedy accession. This resolution highlights both nations’ political and military successes, and calls on the Senate to ratify their accession to NATO as soon as possible,” said Sen. Risch.“I’m proud to join my colleagues to introduce this Resolution as a testament to our commitment to revitalize our rock solid bond with NATO as the most powerful alliance in the history of the world and an absolutely essential pillar of U.S. national security. Putin has empowered NATO’s mission and the world’s resolve to stand united against his aggression. As I expressed to President Niinistö of Finland and Prime Minister Andersson of Sweden during our meeting in the Capitol last week, we fully support their application to become NATO members and are looking forward to their swift ascension in the coming months,” said Sen. Menendez.“NATO has been the cornerstone of Western defense since World War II, and President Niinistö of Finland and Prime Minister Andersson of Sweden are showing strong leadership in joining the United States and its allies against Putin’s deeply immoral campaign of violence. As the world’s democracies unite against Putin and his crony oligarchs, Finland and Sweden’s ascension into NATO will be a further rebuke of Putin’s murderous attack on Ukraine. As Majority Leader, I commit to moving their acceptance into NATO swiftly through the Senate and expect broad bipartisan support. The people of Ukraine continue to fight bravely against Russian aggression and every democracy across the globe has an obligation to stand with Ukraine,” said Sen. Schumer.“Finland and Sweden are strong countries with formidable military capabilities that surpass many existing NATO allies. Both nations’ robust defense funding means their accession would meaningfully bolster our pursuit of greater burden-sharing across the alliance. I fully support the Senate providing its advice and consent as quickly as possible,” said Sen. McConnell.“As the Ukrainian people fight for their lives and freedom, Finland and Sweden’s commitment to join the transatlantic alliance at this pivotal time matters not just for Ukraine, but for Europe, global stability and the future of liberal democracies around the world. As co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group, I’m proud of the continued bipartisan efforts in Congress to ensure that Senate support for NATO remains strong, especially amid Putin’s unprovoked, bloody invasion of Ukraine. This new bipartisan resolution builds on that progress and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to ratify Sweden and Finland’s accession into NATO as soon as possible, and I encourage other NATO allies to do the same,” said Sen. Shaheen.This resolution:The full text of the resolution can be found here.###"
https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-sen-portman-colleagues-defund-biden-s-disinformation-governance-board,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined U.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and 16 of their Republican colleagues in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security expressing opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Disinformation Governance Board and urging that any funding for such board be prohibited in the FY 2023 appropriations bill.“[…] little remains known as to what the board will actually do, how it will determine what is disinformation, and the scope in which it will take to monitor disinformation from American citizens…Absent of these necessary guardrails to prevent mission creep, there is substantial risk of government overreach and First Amendment infringements. While DHS has promised the board will ‘protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties,’ we do not take solace in words alone. A fine line exists between tackling disinformation and government censorship. Exactly where the Disinformation Governance Board falls on this line remains unclear and the potential for abuse is so egregious that we urge any and all funding for the board be prohibited during the Homeland Security appropriations process,” said the senators.Sens. Johnson and Rob Portman were joined on the letter by Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), John Kennedy (R-La.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Mitt Romney (R-Utah)The full text of the letter can be found here and below.  Dear Chairman Murphy and Ranking Member Capito:We write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Disinformation Governance Board and urge that any funding for such a board be prohibited in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Homeland Security appropriations bill, including but not limited to the prohibition of funds for detailed staff. Additionally, we urge that no funds allocated to any of DHS’s offices or components be used to support the Board or any functions of the board. The federal government should never be in the business of regulating speech or being the arbiter of truth, and this latest attempt to engage in that slippery slope should be defunded.The existence of the board was first brought to light during congressional hearings in April, but we now know it has been in existence for several months – without having one documented meeting. While DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testified that the board will not be used for political purposes and did his best to explain away serious concerns raised, little remains known as to what the board will actually do, how it will determine what is disinformation, and the scope in which it will take to monitor disinformation from American citizens. It is known, however, that the board’s executive director, Nina Jankowicz, is a hyper-partisan actor whose opinions of free speech and of those she disagrees with are well documented. It is also known that the board currently lacks any guiding policy, mission statement, or charter. Absent of these necessary guardrails to prevent mission creep, there is substantial risk of government overreach and First Amendment infringements. Although recent reports indicate that the board’s operations have been “paused”, Ms. Jankowicz has resigned, and its dissolution is being considered by DHS, its future remains as unclear as its mission.The federal government already has authorities to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda through the Department of State’s Global Engagement Center. Additionally, DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is responsible for informing Americans about disinformation related to elections and critical infrastructure. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the lead agency in the Foreign Influence Task Force. There is no gap in our nation’s ability to counter disinformation threats that this board fills.While DHS has promised the board will “protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties,” we do not take solace in words alone. A fine line exists between tackling disinformation and government censorship. Exactly where the Disinformation Governance Board falls on this line remains unclear and the potential for abuse is so egregious that we urge any and all funding for the board be prohibited during the Homeland Security appropriations process.Sincerely,###"

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) joined Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and 84 of their colleagues in a resolution expressing support for law enforcement officers across the United States. The resolution designates May 15 through May 21, 2022 as “National Police Week” honoring the selfless dedication and sacrifice made by law enforcement officers to protect and serve our communities.The bipartisan resolution honors the 576 law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2021, including nearly 400 who died from COVID-19, as well as the 92 lost to date in 2022.  Last year marked the most intentional killings of police since the September 11, 2001, attacks. In the face of an ongoing pandemic and rise in violent crime, law enforcement personnel continue to answer the call, serving their communities, often at great risk to themselves.“National Police Week is an important time to recognize the service and sacrifice of our brave law enforcement officers and their families. With crime reaching record highs across the country and the increase in officers killed on the job, the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities deserve our support. Their heroism keeps our families safe and we thank the officers for their service,” said Sen. Johnson.Sens.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-introduces-resolution-commending-moldova-for-supporting-ukrainian-refugees,"WASHINGTON – On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), along with Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H) introduced a resolution commending Moldova for its extraordinary efforts in supporting Ukrainian refugees fleeing Putin’s illegal war against Ukraine and expressing support for Moldova’s sovereignty and ongoing reforms. In addition to encouraging Moldova’s continuation of pro-democracy and good governance reforms, the bipartisan resolution urges Europe to integrate Moldova and Ukraine further into its energy architecture.With more than 5 million Ukrainians forced to flee their country due to Russia’s ongoing invasion, the United Nations estimates almost 440,000 refugees entered Moldova since the conflict began—with more than 100,000 choosing to remain in Moldova. Despite its small size, the Moldovan government has quickly become a global leader in helping Ukrainian refugees since Putin launched his illegal invasion, creating “Green Corridors” to facilitate the crossing of refugees from Ukraine to Romania and other European countries.“I’m proud to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this resolution recognizing the admirable efforts Moldova has taken to protect and support the people of Ukraine. The humanitarian crisis caused by Putin’s unprovoked atrocities in Ukraine has led many to action. To see the outpouring of support for the Ukrainian people by Moldova is a testament to the strong relationships among members of the transatlantic community. By opening their home to Ukrainian refugees, Moldova is sending a clear message to Putin and his cronies—we stand with Ukraine,” said Sen. Johnson.“As a grandfather, as a son of refugees, and above all else as an American, I am honored to lead my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan resolution to commend the people of Moldova for opening their hearts and homes to Ukrainians seeking safe haven after being forced to leave their entire life behind. This incredible generosity not only merits international recognition, but powerfully demonstrates Moldova’s rightful place as part of the transatlantic community. We must continue to support Moldova’s international humanitarian engagement and its great strides over the last year to advance democratic reform and the rule of law,” said Sen. Menendez.“I’m glad to join my colleagues in cosponsoring this resolution recognizing the outsized effort Moldova has made to support the people of Ukraine. Despite the individual challenges Moldova faces from Russia, including economic coercion, malign influence, and unrest in Russia-backed Transnistria, the Moldovan people have risen to the occasion and helped to save hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Moldova deserves commendation for this emergency effort, as well as the support of the United States and our allies for its contribution to security and stability for Ukraine and the transatlantic community at large,” said Sen.

I’m proud to join this bipartisan resolution encouraging the U.S. to provide Moldova with additional aid for their inspiring response in ensuring the safe passage of Ukrainian families into Europe.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-statement-on-vote-for-defense-spending-amid-ukraine-war,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released a statement on his vote to approve defense spending amid Russia's attack on Ukraine:“Given current Congressional leadership, it is not surprising the Ukraine supplemental is far from perfect. Most disappointing, the spending is not offset when hundreds of billions of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill is still available. But I could not let perfect be the enemy of the necessary. The war in Ukraine is an unprovoked atrocity against a nation that posed no threat to Russia. Vladimir Putin’s naked aggression cannot be tolerated or rewarded by indifference by western democracies. The human toll is already incalculable and the cost of rebuilding Ukraine will be measured in the hundreds of billions. World food security is also significantly threatened as the war drags on. Also, a large part of the spending will be allocated to replenishing U.S. military stockpiles to maintain our nation’s readiness and security. We must provide courageous Ukrainians with the economic and military assistance they need to defend their families and freedom and give them the capacity to bring this war to an end.” ### "

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined U.S. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and 50 of their Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter to President Joe Biden urging the Administration to include Taiwan in negotiations for the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). In addition to recognizing Taiwan’s importance to the United States as an important trading partner, the senators underscored that failing to include Taiwan in IPEF runs counter to U.S. economic interests in the region.“IPEF can be a meaningful first step for the United States to assure its allies and partners that we are economically engaged in the region, which accounts for sixty percent of the world economy and two-thirds of all economic growth over the last five years. For IPEF to be a useful vehicle to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, however, we must make sure that all of America’s regional allies and partners are included. This is just one necessary aspect to ensuring the framework is competitive in a region already saturated with economic treaties and agendas,” said the senators.In addition to requesting that the Biden administration engage with the Committee on the issue and provide a briefing on economic security policy toward Taiwan, the senators also underscored that excluding Taiwan would significantly distort both the regional and global economic architecture.“The more economic engagement U.S. and allies and partners have with Taiwan, the stronger our collective resilience against coercion. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows the value of tangible economic support by the United States and like-minded allies and partners, and the same is true for Taiwan. Including Taiwan in the IPEF would be an invaluable signal of our rock-solid commitment to Taiwan and its prosperity and freedom,” the senators continued. Sen. Johnson and Jim Risch were joined on the letter by Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), John Thune (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.)The full text of the letter can be found here.### "

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and eight of their colleagues in a bipartisan resolution condemning the Russian government’s unjust detention of Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza.  The bipartisan resolution pays tribute to Kara-Murza’s advocacy for democracy and human rights in Russia and his opposition to Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  Additionally, it urges the U.S. and its allies to work to secure Kara-Murza’s immediate release and to support those advocating for democratic reform and independent media in Russia.“The fabricated charges against Kara-Murza are ridiculous but sadly predictable. He is a man of courage targeted by a tyrant war criminal for telling the Russian people the truth about the Putin regime’s atrocities in Ukraine.

https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/5/sen-johnson-joins-sen-cassidy-colleagues-in-resolution-calling-on-white-house-to-combat-rising-crime-border-crisis,"WASHINGTON – On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) and 29 of their Republican colleagues in a resolution calling on the Biden administration to work with Congress to develop a plan to combat the rise in crime and crisis at the southern border. The resolution comes as the nation honors National Police Week.Wisconsin communities have faced a drastic rise in crime as a result of Democrat policies. In August 2020, Kenosha erupted in violent riots that resulted in $50 million in damage following the shooting of Jacob Blake. In December 2021, Waukesha faced an unimaginable tragedy when six innocent bystanders were killed and 62 more were injured during the Waukesha Christmas Parade. Recently, a pro-life office was destroyed during a politically motivated attack in Madison. As families and communities across the state and nation fear for their safety, Sen. Johnson and his colleagues call on the Biden administration to work with Congress to develop and execute a strategy to solve the crime crisis.“Rising crime, especially violent crime, in the United States poses a threat to the national interest, as well as to the safety and security of individuals, communities, businesses, law enforcement officers, and the rule of law,” the resolution reads in part.“Violent crimes are occurring every day in major cities across the United States in part due to progressive prosecutors declining to charge violent offenders and certain bail reform policies allowing dangerous criminals back into society,” the resolution continues.In March, Sen. Johnson introduced the Pretrial Release Reporting Act to inform Americans on the frequency of violent offenders that are being released into their communities on bail or other pretrial release condition. The bill requires the Department of Justice to issue a report to Congress detailing information on individuals released on bail and pretrial release that are charged with violent felony offenses, and how state courts assess bail when releasing individuals charged with violent felony offenses.Sens. Johnson and Bill Cassidy are joined on the resolution by Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Todd Young (R-Ind.). The full text of the resolution can be found here.### "

The legislation counters the Biden administration's efforts to coerce and punish service members who decline the COVID-19 vaccine, and introduces accountability measures in response to DoD efforts to undermine transparency.This bill would require the Secretary of Defense to make every effort to retain unvaccinated service members, strengthen language to ensure service members receive discharge classifications commensurate with their record of service, require the Department of Defense to report the number and type of COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions that have been denied, and create an exemption from COVID-19 vaccine requirements for service members with natural immunity. The act would also protect service academy students and Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) members in the same way.Supply shortages of infant formula are putting unimaginable burdens on parents.

Califf, M.D., MACCCommissionerFood and Drug Administration The Honorable Alejandro MayorkasSecretaryDepartment of Homeland Security The Honorable Katherine C. TaiUnited States Trade Representative Dear Commissioner Califf, Secretary Mayorkas and Ambassador Tai:Supply shortages of infant formula are putting unimaginable burdens on parents.[1]  The severe shortage of infant formula appears to be a result of supply chain constraints and the shutdown of a major production facility in Michigan.[2]  Families are already facing 40-year high inflation and surging energy costs.  These parents should not have to also worry about how to feed their babies.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and United States Trade Representative (USTR) owes the public a detailed explanation about the steps the agencies are taking to ensure parents and their babies have access to infant formula.              According to reports, in 2021, the out of stock rates for infant formula were between 2 and 8 percent.[3]  By the end of April 2022, an estimated 40 percent of U.S. baby formula supplies were out of stock.[4]  The ongoing shortages are reportedly the result of supply chain and labor issues.[5]               The February 2022 shutdown of a major formula plant in Sturgis, Michigan, is also contributing to the shortages.[6]  FDA investigated the Sturgis plant in mid-February 2022 in response to complaints of a rare bacterial infection in four babies.[7]  The FDA reportedly found safety violations and five strains of bacteria at the plant, although the strains apparently do not match the bacteria of the illnesses.[8]               Recently, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated the FDA is “working around the clock” to address the formula shortage.[9]  On May 10, 2022, you stated that FDA is “doing everything in our power to ensure there is adequate product available where and when [consumers] need it.”[10]  However, the Biden administration is not doing all it can to increase product availability.  For instance, the federal government could eliminate tariffs of up to 17.5 percent and tariff rate quotas (TRQs) on imported infant formula.[11]As hard-working American parents struggle to find infant formula, a recent news report indicated that illegal immigrants detained by Border Patrol may not be experiencing these difficulties.[12]  A Member of Congress reportedly obtained photographs from a Border Patrol agent showing that shelves at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detention center in McAllen, Texas are stocked with “‘pallets’ of baby formula.”[13]  The lawmaker claimed that “they’re receiving pallets and more pallets of baby formula at the border.”[14] [15]  The assurances made by an untrustworthy administration and the lack of action do little to subdue the frustrations and anxieties of many parents that see a dwindling supply of infant formula for their babies.  The American people and parents have a right to be angry.  In order to better understand the steps the FDA is taking to alleviate supply chain constraints and barriers to production, please provide the following information:Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than May 27, 2022.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.Sincerely,###[1] Breck Dumas, Baby formula shortage hits ‘crisis’ level, sparking panic in parents across US, Fox Business (May 10, 2022), available at

WrayDirectorFederal Bureau of Investigation The Honorable Alejandro MayorkasSecretaryU.S. Department of Homeland Security Dear Attorney General Garland, Director Wray and Secretary Mayorkas:              I write to you regarding the recent politically-motivated attack on the Wisconsin Family Action office in Madison, Wisconsin. According to news reports, the attackers threw a Molotov cocktail into the Wisconsin Family Action Madison office and painted “if abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either” on the building.[1] A pro-abortion group called “Jane’s Revenge” claimed responsibility for the attack, stating “This was only a warning… next time the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive. . . Wisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings.[2]” However, to date, President Biden has made no public remarks, and neither the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), nor the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have issued a statement condemning this attack.              I am unfortunately compelled to write to you about this matter because DOJ has a track record of not prosecuting left-wing violence as we have seen with the summer of 2020 riots that occurred nationwide.[3] In 2020, extremists exploited demonstrations across the country to incite riots that resulted in the loss of life, more than 2,000 injuries to law enforcement officers, and over $1 billion in property damage.[4] There are currently mobs outside of the residences of the Supreme Court Justices appointed by Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The intimidation of sitting Supreme Court Justices is a clear violation of federal law,[5] and, once again, DOJ, FBI, and DHS have yet to condemn these activities. Compare your silence on these events to your robust actions against parents attending public school board meetings to voice their concerns about far-left ideologies being integrated into school curriculums.[6]              Based on the attack on the Madison pro-life organization, Jane’s Revenge fits federal agencies’ definitions of “domestic violent extremists” and the attack as a “domestic terrorism incident.” The FBI defines a ‘domestic terrorism incident’ as an “ideologically-driven criminal act, including threats or acts of violence made to specific victims, made in furtherance of a domestic ideological goal that has occurred and can be confirmed.”[7] Additionally, the FBI and DHS define a ‘domestic violent extremist’ as an individual “who seeks to further their ideological goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence.”[8] Attacking a pro-life organization in a manner that could have injured or killed the office’s occupants due to differing political ideologies fits these definitions. It seems, however, that DOJ and DHS reserve those definitions for parents attending school board meetings or individuals who disagree with the policies of this Administration.[9]I want to reemphasize that your silence on this abhorrent attack against a pro-life organization is deafening and your continued silence could be construed as a tacit endorsement of such attacks against those who hold different or opposing political beliefs from those of this Administration. I respectfully request the following information to learn more about your positions and actions to address this attack in light of your silence.Please provide this information as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. on May 27, 2022.
