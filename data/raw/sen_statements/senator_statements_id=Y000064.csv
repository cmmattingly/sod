https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-leads-bipartisan-bicameral-ukraine-human-rights-policy-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), along with Congressmen Pat Fallon (R-Texas) and Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act of 2022. This legislation would put in place a robust mechanism to hold the Russian Federation accountable for the countless human rights abuses it has committed against the people of Ukraine. “I have met with the spouses and mothers of Ukrainian soldiers currently imprisoned by Russian thugs who have no idea if their loved ones are alive or dead. I have met with Ukrainians who have suffered in unspeakable ways going back to Russia’s first invasion of Crimea in 2014. Russia’s egregious human rights abuses must be met with accountability, both today and in the future. By ensuring strong sanctions are placed on the Russian Federation, this bill marks a step toward justice for the thousands of Ukrainians suffering at the hands of Russia’s barbaric aggression in Ukraine. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan bill to hold Vladimir Putin accountable and urge its passage by Congress,” said Senator Young. Specifically, this bill would:      Senator Rosen issued the following statement: ""The horrific atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine - including the recent discovery of mass graves filled with innocent Ukrainian men, women, and children - cannot go unanswered. As we continue to stand with Ukraine in pursuing justice for these crimes, I’m helping introduce bipartisan legislation to hold Russia accountable for its human rights abuses, and I thank Senator Young and Representatives Panetta and Fallon for their partnership on this bill."" Congressman Fallon stated: “I could not think of a more fitting bill to introduce with my House and Senate colleagues following the UN Security Council Meeting and the horrific mass graves uncovered in Izyum. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reflects Vladimir Putin’s complete disregard for human life. Reports indicate that Vladimir Putin’s war machine is responsible for the forced relocation of over 1 million Ukrainian citizens and almost 15,000 civilian casualties. It’s barbarism such as this that has led my colleagues and I to this legislation. Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation deserve to be held accountable for every atrocity that they have committed.  “The Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act of 2022 provides the United States more tools to accomplish this very goal. The world must ensure justice for every man, woman, and child of Ukraine.” Congressman Panetta added:   “As Russia continues its ruthless and remorseless attack on Ukraine, the Ukrainian people are experiencing, and the world is witnessing human rights atrocities. By expanding the authority to apply sanctions against Russia, our Ukraine Human Rights Policy Act is a device to hold Russia accountable for its heinous acts and a deterrent against further crimes against humanity.  This bipartisan legislation is consonant with the United States leadership on assisting Ukraine and countering Russia and consistent with our values as the world’s leading democracy.”   Foundation for Defense of Democracies Action provided the following statement of support: “This bipartisan legislation provides a critical pathway for Congress to provide much needed oversight of the administration’s efforts to hold Russian human rights violators in Ukraine and elsewhere accountable.”  "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-stand-with-sportsmen-introduce-bill-to-stop-the-ban-of-traditional-ammo-and-tackle,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), along with 21 additional Senate colleagues, introduced a bill to prohibit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from banning the use of traditional lead ammunition or tackle on public lands unless such action is supported by the best available science and state wildlife and fish agencies.  This bill also comes one week after FWS published a rule that, while expanding access to hunting and fishing at certain wildlife refuges, prohibited the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle.Last spring, FWS entered into settlement negotiations with activist organizations over a lawsuit regarding the use of traditional ammunition and lead on over 3 million acres of federal land.  Senators Young and Daines were joined by U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Dan Sullivan (R-Ala.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Quotes of Support: “Both The Bass Federation and The Walleye Federation and our various chapters in 49 states fully support this proposed legislation by Senator Daines and others. History has proven there are no better stewards and supporters of fish, game, conservation and our natural resources than Anglers and Hunters we would not support anything that would endanger those resources. But we simply cannot support blanket federal bans that effect millions of acres of publicly owned resources when it is purely political overreach and there is simply no science or data to support it.” –Robert Cartlidge President and CEO, The Bass Federation and The Walleye Federation “Sportsmen have always taken responsible leadership in addressing what is needed to protect wildlife. Now they need some protection. The Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act prohibits arbitrary restrictions on lead ammunition and tackle.  Lead, like many other elements, can exist in the environment without impacting wildlife populations, especially in the infinitesimal amount left by hunting. Research and development of non-lead ammunition is curtailed by Federal rules and therefore a limited alternative.  This bill will keep the country on a science-based path to solving documented problems with lead as they arise.” – Gray Thornton, President and CEO, Wild Sheep Foundation"

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-stabenow-introduce-bipartisan-early-pell-promise-act,"WASHINGTON –– Today, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) introduced bipartisan legislation to help make sure that students who work hard to get into college can enroll regardless of their financial circumstances. Under current law, students only find out how much financial aid they will receive right before attending college. The Early Pell Promise Actwould provide more financial certainty for families by pre-qualifying certain students for full Pell Grant support starting as early as the eighth grade. It also would ensure that families and students who pre-qualify for aid receive additional information about the cost of college attendance and student financial aid.“Many Hoosier families would benefit from knowing how much financial aid they can count on receiving long before their child’s first day of college. The Early Pell Promise Act works to ensure young Hoosiers are set up for success in our higher education system through pre-qualification for Pell grants as early as the eighth grade. This will help more students to afford higher education and plan for a prosperous future,” said Senator Young. “Too many young people in Michigan aren't aware of the resources available to help them find the right college, let alone how to make it a reality,” said Senator Stabenow. “Every child in America, no matter their financial situation, should know that if they work hard, study hard, and get good grades, the opportunity to attend college will be available after high school.”Text of the legislation is available here.  "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-bill-makes-taxpayers-advocacy-groups-no-brainers-list,"WASHINGTON – Today, a bill introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) – the Emergency Savings Act – was selected by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) for its 12th annual “No Brainers” list. NTU is an advocacy organization that fights for responsible tax policy and spending reductions throughout the federal government. Each year, NTU selects ten “no-brainer” bills that can bridge the partisan divide. Each bill meets three important criteria: 1) it has bipartisan support, 2) it has not been on a prior NTU “No Brainers” list, and 3) it is a common-sense solution to a real problem facing taxpayers. “I’m proud that my Emergency Savings Act made NTU’s annual ‘No Brainers’ list for Congress to pass this year. This bill is a common-sense, bipartisan solution that would help families create stable emergency savings for unforeseen expenses, while keeping retirement accounts intact for the future,” said Senator Young. ""Senator Young has been a leader in Congress when it comes to helping more Americans save more for emergency needs, which is why NTU is proud to include his Emergency Savings Act in our 12th annual No Brainers list. NTU applauds Senator Young and his bipartisan partner on this legislation, Senator Booker, for their thoughtful work on this pro-consumer, pro-taxpayer bill,”said Andrew Lautz, Director of Federal Policy for National Taxpayers Union.  Senator Young introduced the bipartisan Emergency Savings Act earlier this year to help Americans build savings for the future. The bill would facilitate convenient and affordable access to workplace emergency savings accounts, improving financial security and reducing retirement savings leakage. Separating emergency savings from one’s retirement savings account will provide participants a better understanding that one account is for short-term emergency needs and the other is for long-term retirement savings, thus empowering employees to handle unexpected financial shocks without jeopardizing their long-term financial security in retirement through emergency hardship withdrawals. The Emergency Savings Account Act builds upon work by Senators Young and Booker to develop this concept over the last several years, including the Strengthening Financial Security Through Short-Term Savings Accounts Act of 2021. To see what supporters are saying about the Emergency Savings Act, click here.Last year, two of Senator Young’s bills – the American Innovation and Jobs Act and Yes In My Backyard (YIMBY) Act – were selected for NTU’s 11th Annual “No Brainers” list.

The letter invoked the words of George Washington while calling on Leader Schumer to schedule a vote on the NDAA in time for an open Senate amendment process to take place. Among other priorities, the legislation funds military technology, strengthens capabilities, and delivers a 4.6 percent pay raise to America’s service members. “At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well. Two centuries later, that still rings true. Yet should this body fail in its top Constitutional responsibility of providing for a common defense, our armed services will be left directionless, lack stable funding, and be devoid of civilian Congressional oversight,” the senators wrote. “Members of the House passed their NDAA on July 14th, by a vote of 329 – 101,” the senators continued.“For the bill to go to conference and make it to President Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the opportunity to debate the Senate version with an open amendment process. As such, we the undersigned respectfully request that you call the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 to the Senate floor before the conclusion of the September work period.” Joining Senators Young and Tuberville in the letter are U.S. Senators John Cornyn (R-Texas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Dan Sullivan (R-Ark.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). A copy of the letter can be found hereand below. Leader Schumer, At the founding of our nation, then-General George Washington penned, “When the civil and military powers cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each other there can be little doubt of things going well.” Two centuries later, that still rings true.

The bill would allow for comprehensive federal regulatory permitting and project review reform. “Permitting delays, regulatory inefficiencies, and red tape are all reasons why our nation’s energy infrastructure – from renewable energy to fossil fuel projects – are stuck in limbo,” said Senator Young. “At a time when advancing our domestic energy security is vitally important, the START Act is a much-needed step to reduce self-imposed barriers and provide certainty for our supply chains.” “Since our calls for action and offers to see legislative text from the permitting ‘deal’ remain unheeded, Republicans are introducing this legislation today to deliver solutions to the roadblocks, delays, and postponements of key infrastructure projects across the country,” said Ranking Member Capito. “The START Act would provide regulatory certainty to states, expedite permitting and review processes, codify substantive environmental regulatory reforms, and expedite permitting of the critically important Mountain Valley Pipeline. Republicans are unified in working to deliver needed permitting reform, and this legislation is a blueprint for how we can help communities benefit from being able to finally get critical projects across the finish line.” Cosponsors of the legislation include U.S. Senators Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Full text of the legislation can be found here. A section by section summary can be found here and below. BILL DETAILS: Section 2 - Codification of NEPA Regulations Codifies the Trump Administration’s modernized National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. Section 3 - Providing Regulatory Certainty Codifies the Trump Administration’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule’s definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act.  Codifies the Trump Administration’s Section 401 Certification Rule under the Clean Water Act to prevent state actions that unreasonably block energy projects.  Codifies Nationwide Permits issued in 2021 that streamline Section 404 permitting for the development of critical energy projects and other activities under the Clean Water Act. Lengthens the available approval term of permits issued under delegated state water permit programs from 5 to 10 years. Section 4 - Limiting New Red Tape and Costs for Gasoline and Other Fuels Prohibits the use and adoption of the Biden Administration’s interim estimates for the “social cost of greenhouse gases” and any other estimates that may raise gasoline prices. Section 5 - Expediting Permitting and Review Processes Codifies key elements of the One Federal Decision framework for energy projects, including timely approvals for projects, permitting review schedules for projects that are no longer than two years, and limitations on the page length of environmental documents. Provides litigation certainty on the timing of judicial challenges to energy project approvals.  Allows agencies to share and use one another’s categorical exclusions for energy projects under NEPA.  Section 6 - States’ Authorities in Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations Grants states the sole authority to promulgate or enforce any regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing on or under any land within their boundaries. Clarifies that the exclusivity of this regulation applies to all federal lands located in the state. Section 7 - Federal Lands Freedom Act Grants states the right to develop energy resources on the federal lands located within their borders. This section gives states the ability to proactively and responsibly develop energy on federal lands.  Allows a state to develop a regulatory program governing the leasing and permitting of energy activities on its federal land. Section 8 - Expedited Approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline Expedites the approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project within 21 days of enactment. This section paves the way for another American energy revolution by taking concrete steps to buck the policies that are holding American energy producers back to the benefit of hostile regimes with inferior environmental standards. Section 9 - Reducing Timeframes for Endangered Species Act Consultations Reforms the Section 7 consultation process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by shortening consultation timelines from 90 to 60 days. Also shortens thresholds for ending or extending consultation times from 150 to 100 days. This section reforms a well-known roadblock to efficient permitting. Section 10 - New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act Reforms the New Source Review (NSR) program under the Clean Air Act. This environmental regulation actually prevents industry from making upgrades to existing facilities to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Provides greater regulatory certainty about when facility upgrades require a permit. Section 11 - No Retroactive Permit Vetoes Clarifies existing law to promote timely and thorough consideration of Clean Water Act Section 404 permits, and eliminates unfair and confusing permitting actions in order to support domestic energy production. Section 12 – Policy Review under the Clean Air Act Strikes the statutory mandate under the Clean Air Act Section 309 that EPA review and comment on newly authorized federal projects for construction or any major federal action that falls under NEPA for environmental review as well as agency regulations."

That's why I joined a resolution challenging the Biden administration’s burdensome new restrictions on charter schools seeking federal funding,"" said Senator Young. “Time and time again, this administration has bowed to big-labor unions and liberal extremists at the expense of children’s futures. Now they are outdoing themselves with rules that will undermine charter schools — tuition-free, top-notch public education options that serve primarily disadvantaged students,” said Senator Scott. “Support for these schools has never been a partisan issue. It’s time the administration put politics aside and joined parents in the fight for quality education.” Cosponsors of the resolution include Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.). Background: Earlier this year, the Department of Education announced new rules overhauling the 28-year-old, bipartisan Charter School Program (CSP). The changes would place federal, one-size-fits-all requirements on charter schools, making it difficult — if not impossible — for many of these high-quality public schools to receive funding. Despite substantial bipartisan backlash, the administration is moving ahead with its plans, which will strip families of education choice and give more power to big labor unions and bureaucrats in D.C.  Click here to read about the CRA in Fox News. Click here for full text of the CRA."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-releases-op-ed-preventing-another-public-health-crisis,"WASHINGTON –– Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) released an op-ed on his legislation to fight antimicrobial resistance. The Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Upsurging Resistance (PASTEUR) Act would encourage development of innovative antibiotics to treat resistant infections and improve appropriate antibiotic use for Hoosiers. The full op-ed is below and available for publication: Preventing Another Public Health CrisisBy Senator Todd Young  The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated America’s vulnerability to catastrophic public health crises. And it highlighted the urgency of taking reasonable measures to prevent them in the future. While it is not dominating current news headlines, the next public health crisis is already here: the emergence of bacteria resistant to antibiotic treatment. Antimicrobials—including antibiotics—play a fundamental role in our health care system’s most common and most complex medical procedures, preventing infection, fighting disease, and saving lives along the way. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs naturally when bacteria and other microbes evolve traits that make them more difficult to kill. Unfortunately, the overuse and misuse of life-saving antibiotics have dangerously accelerated this natural process, increasingly burdening our health system with infections that cannot be as effectively treated with antibiotics. In fact, research shows that roughly 30 percent of antibiotics used in hospitals are unnecessary or prescribed incorrectly.  As it stands, AMR is already far from an abstract public health threat. Today, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that antibiotic resistance kills someone in the United States every 15 minutes, amounting to at least 35,000 lives lost annually. And unless our pharmaceutical innovators create new, more potent drugs, AMR is expected to be the leading cause of death worldwide by 2050. Yet as these resistant infections rise and deaths are projected to increase, the global pipeline of antibiotics in development remains stagnant. This is because drug makers everywhere face unique disincentives when it comes to developing new antimicrobials: to slow AMR and keep these medications effective for as long as possible, many doctors rightly try to limit their use to only those cases in which they are truly necessary. But this limited use can result in low sale volumes, making it difficult for the companies developing and producing these innovative antibiotics to stay in business. As a result, there are far too few drugs in development to treat the most dangerous pathogens. Over the last several decades, we have made significant advancements in areas like cancer, organ transplantation, and cystic fibrosis. But these advancements are undermined as patients lose their lives to untreatable resistant infections. Common procedures like hip and knee replacements and caesarian sections carry serious infection risks and are becoming more dangerous as our antibiotic options dwindle. This is a growing public health threat, and Hoosiers should not have to worry that antibiotics are not doing their intended job. Our health system must preemptively combat antibiotic resistance and ensure we do not return to an era when even a simple medical procedure could be deadly. The PASTEUR Act, which I introduced with Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), incentivizes the development of new antibiotics, spurring urgently needed innovation. Currently, the drug reimbursement system in our country rewards volume, not value. The federal government pays for antimicrobials in a way that fails to drive innovation or appropriate use. The PASTEUR Act would introduce a new model for paying for novel antimicrobials—one that incentivizes the development of antimicrobials based upon the value they provide for public health, rather than the volume used. The PASTEUR Act would help reinvigorate the antibiotics pipeline by providing sizable, subscription-based government contracts for access to innovative, high-priority antibiotics. Importantly, the federal government only pays once – the subscription payment is all-inclusive, and the PASTEUR Act only pays for success. This approach addresses the core issue confronting the antibiotics market: the pressing need for effective, innovative drugs that don’t have high sales potential. At the same time, the PASTEUR Act would focus on educating health care providers on how to avoid overuse or misuse of these life-saving medications in order to slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. It is a proactive initiative to meet an emerging crisis head on.  Every year we wait to address the crisis of AMR is another year patients and providers must struggle to access life-saving medicines. After our nation has endured a pandemic, this is the type of much-needed reform to our health system that all Americans will support. Our hard-earned experience from the last public health crisis can lead to a renewed motivation to prepare for the next one before it’s too late. Let’s pass the PASTEUR Act."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-bill-to-rename-st-joseph-va-clinic-in-honor-of-late-rep-jackie-walorski,"WASHINGTON –– Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Clinic in Mishawaka, Indiana the “Jackie Walorski VA Clinic.” The bill, supported by the entire Indiana House delegation, passed the House of Representatives last month and will now go to the President’s desk to be signed into law. Indiana Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced an identical version of the bill in the Senate. “Jackie was a good friend and committed public servant, and we miss her deeply. During her service, Jackie never lost sight of protecting our Hoosier veterans. Renaming the Mishawaka VA Clinic in Jackie’s honor is just one way her legacy will live on for years to come,” said Senator Young. “Jackie Walorski dedicated her life to serving Hoosiers, and had a special passion for helping veterans and their families get the benefits they have earned. It is right that this VA Clinic be named in Jackie Walorski’s honor,” said Senator Braun.On Wednesday, August 3, Rep. Walorski died in a tragic car accident while traveling in Indiana’s second district. Rep. Walorski served on the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs during her congressional career, and she championed important reforms to improve the quality and accessibility of services for our nation’s military veterans and the lives of veteran constituents at home. Her tireless work on behalf of veterans included helping to secure the new Mishawaka VA clinic, which opened in 2017 to improve access to care for Hoosier veterans."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-releases-op-ed-on-chips-and-science-act,"America went on offense against the Chinese Communist Party earlier this month. Legislation I worked on for years to out-innovate and outcompete China was signed into law on August 9. The legislation went by many titles – the Endless Frontier Act, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and finally the CHIPS and Science Act. No matter its name, enacting this legislation into law is a win for Indiana and a bold investment in America’s national security. I wrote the original version of this bill recognizing that we are in an ongoing global power competition with China. In many crucial areas, Beijing is gaining ground or even ahead of the U.S. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has invested $14 trillion in the frontier technologies that will shape our modern economy and decide winners of future wars – technologies like quantum computing, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence. China has even made advances in hypersonic technology, which allows missiles carrying nuclear projectiles to travel at five times the speed of sound while evading our current defense systems. In the last year, Hoosiers saw just how vulnerable – militarily and economically – America is to an increasingly technologically superior China. First, China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile capable of circling the earth before speeding towards and hitting a target. Then, closer to home America’s supply chain ground to a halt because of a shortage of semiconductors, leaving plants like General Motors in Fort Wayne sitting idle. These tiny chips bring life to our cellphones, cars, appliances – almost anything with a motor or a plug, including our military platforms. Many of our major domestic industries were put on pause because we are so reliant on other nations for computer chips. America makes only 12 percent of the global supply of semiconductors, and China is investing heavily in semiconductor production. China accounted for less than four percent of the market half a decade ago, but is now on pace to control roughly 20 percent of the market by 2024. If China produces more and more of the world’s supply of semiconductors, America’s economy and security could be at the mercy of the CCP, especially in the event of another pandemic or war. After all, 90 percent the chips in our military hardware are currently made overseas. This is all part of Beijing’s bet to beat America. But the CHIPS and Science Act helps America counter that bet. This new law provides $52.7 billion to jumpstart semiconductor production here in the United States. A thriving domestic chip industry will prevent future supply chain stoppages and safeguard our military readiness.  And it will benefit the Heartland economy. A corridor of the semiconductor industry will run through Indiana. Thanks to this law, SkyWater Technology is moving forward with plans to partner with Purdue to build a $1.8 billion dollar facility in West Lafayette that will manufacture semiconductor chips and create an estimated 750 jobs. The CHIPS and Science Act also provides $2 billion for Department of Defense semiconductors. NSWC Crane, with its expertise in chip manufacturing, is expected to play a significant role in this effort, in turn creating economic opportunities across southern Indiana. SkyWater already opened an office in Odon, near Crane. The new law also supercharges funding of basic scientific research and significantly expands STEM education opportunities. And it will establish regional tech hubs across our country to help launch innovative companies, revive American manufacturing, and lay the foundation for new jobs to jumpstart our local communities. Indiana will have an opportunity to apply for a tech hub designation, and Hoosiers have good reason to be optimistic about our state’s chance of success. These Heartland investments are incredibly important at a time when just a handful of American cities account for nearly 90 percent of job growth in advanced sectors like tech, computer manufacturing, biotech, and telecom. The truth is our country faces a defense deficit, in large part because the Chinese government is heavily subsidizing industries and the development of mission critical technologies that the CCP hopes will give it an upper hand, both militarily and economically. It is simply not a level playing field. Given this reality, we face two choices: do nothing and cede the future, or make smart investments in the American people and our national security to win the future. By passing the CHIPS and Science Act, we are building a more prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-introduces-doug-zembiec-gold-star-family-support-act-of-2022,"WASHINGTON –– U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) recently introduced the Doug Zembiec Gold Star Family Support Act of 2022 to create a pilot program to provide qualified grief companions to improve bereavement care for survivors. Major Doug Zembiec was a United States Naval Academy classmate of Senator Young who was also commissioned into the Marine Corps following graduation. An infantry and Force Reconnaissance officer, Major Zembiec led Marines in combat during the Iraq War. Following his tragic death in action in 2007, his family received assistance from casualty assistance officers, but more could have been done to provide comfort as they responded to the trauma of losing Doug.Originally an idea of Doug’s wife Pam, this legislation will ensure that the Department of Defense is prioritizing the comfort and care of survivors as they transition out of the military community and throughout the grieving process. “Our Gold Star families suffer tremendous loss when their loved one pays the ultimate price and sacrifices their life for our freedoms. I’ve made it a priority to protect these Hoosier families who have already given so much. While the military has Service Members and Chaplains standing by to assist, providing someone who understands their loss and is able to walk them through their grief is a vital component that this pilot program aims to address,” said Senator Young. “Military spouses have the strength of a thousand, but the sudden, tragic, and violent death of my husband was unlike any other life adversity, his loss shattered my world. If I would’ve had someone like me to accompany my casualty assistance officer, someone sent from our government with lived experience during the initial year, it would have eased the strain.  We need the expertise of our casualty officers, but they need the help of someone with lived experience.  Surviving military families will have their own experience within a complex military culture and having someone to help them find what benefits and services best suit their unique needs is imperative to the idiosyncratic nature of grief. Most importantly, as a servicemember never leaves another servicemember behind on the battlefield, as a country, we mustn’t leave behind their family members in the aftermath of the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms,” said Pam Zembiec No later than 90 days after the date the bill is passed, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness will carry out a pilot program on providing training to, validating, and deploying grief companions to facilitate bereavement care provided by the Department of Defense following casualty notifications. In 2019 and 2020, Senator Young introduced a resolution to designate September 20-26 as “Gold Star Families Remembrance Week” to honor the families of fallen members of the Armed Forces. Gold Star Families Remembrance Week precedes Gold Star Mother’s Day, observed since 1936 on the last Sunday of September."

The Chinese Communist Party actively lobbied against this legislation because they know this bill is bad for China and good for the United States. History will show that by enacting this legislation into law, we are confronting the challenges of today and building a more prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans.” The legislation passed the Senate on July 27 and passed the House of Representatives on July 28.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-votes-against-reckless-tax-and-spend-bill-amidst-worst-inflation-in-forty-years,"WASHINGTON –– U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) today voted against the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend bill, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 50 to 50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie.  “With inflation at a forty-year high and our country in a recession, this bill is the absolute wrong approach to helping Hoosier families,” said Senator Young. “Despite its name, this legislation does nothing to address rising prices or high energy costs. Instead, the bill will raise taxes on nearly every income bracket, spend billions of dollars in Green New Deal waste, double the size of the IRS, and grow big government. This bill is bad for Indiana and won’t help bring relief to those struggling in this challenging economy.”According to analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the legislation will increase the average tax burden on Americans in nearly every income bracket, including those making under $10,000. The legislation will rapidly grow the size of the IRS, likely leading to increased audits of low- and middle-income taxpayers. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, 93% of the bill's promised deficit savings would come after 2026.Senator Young filed amendments and motions to:Eliminate any tax provision in the bill if it may be used to fund or otherwise subsidize the purchase of materials, technology, or critical minerals produced in China"

Representative Walorski tragically passed away in a car accident on August 3, 2022.  “Jackie and I came to Congress at roughly the same time. I will never forget when she arrived here at the U.S. Capitol. Jackie knew that she belonged here. Jackie understood that this was her calling. She didn’t need people to tell her she belonged… Jackie’s last breath was spent in service. In service to her constituents, to her God, to the great state of Indiana, to her country, to her calling. She loved and was faithful to them all, to the great benefit of Indiana and America… Let that be her legacy,” said Senator Young. Young also paid tribute to the other victims of the tragic accident, Edith Schmucker, Zachery Potts, and Emma Thomson.“We grieve them all, and we pray for their family and friends. This is, of course, a profoundly difficult time for those of us who knew one or more of these Hoosiers. We commit to do whatever it is in our power to comfort their loved ones in the difficult days ahead,” said Senator Young. “As Hoosiers share their memories of Jackie Walorski it becomes clear just how many lives she touched. Faith, family, and community were the values that guided Jackie, and times of mourning show us just how important those things truly are. As friends and family grieve for the four lives lost in this tragedy – Jackie, Zach Potts, Emma Thomson, and Edith Schmucker – we will continue to pray that they find consolation in the memory of their loved ones and the marks they left on the lives of others,” said Senator Braun. To watch Senator Young’s floor speech on the resolution, click here. To watch Senator Braun’s floor speech on the resolution, click here. Text of the resolution is available here."

Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine has resulted in the alliance expanding and further strengthened through the accession of Sweden and Finland. Make no mistake, this action by the Senate is a strategic loss and powerful rebuke to Putin and his cronies in Russia.  “The addition of Sweden and Finland will deter further Russian aggression and enable Europe to better defend itself while allowing the United States to more effectively deploy our limited resources to areas like the Indo-Pacific.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-opposes-democrats-latest-tax-and-spend-plan-,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined his Republican colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee for a press conference on Democrats’ new Build Back Bad plan to raise taxes and increase spending during record-high inflation. “The median household income in the state of Indiana is $58,000. Under this plan, families in that income range in my state will see their taxes increase by $2 billion next year alone. I'm here for those families. I'm speaking on behalf of those families. They're upset. They find this absolutely absurd. We are the most manufacturing intensive state in the country. As we've already heard this legislation will slam our manufacturers. This is an anti-Indiana bill,” said Senator Young. To watch the Senator Young’s full remarks, click here. The remarks as delivered: Here we go again. I guess the national Democratic Party has given up on the industrial Midwest, the heartland. They've just given up. Now, it was a year ago next week that Democrats attempted to push through a $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend boondoggle. We won the argument and we won the day. But here we are making the same arguments. My hope is that in the end we will be victorious. I don't believe the Democrats are doing this for political reasons, because I tell you, this is really bad politics back where I live. We have the worst inflation certainly in memory. And they're trying to revive this massive tax-and-spending initiative. So, listen, let's look at the latest iteration of that legislation, which they have in a nod to George Orwell dubbed the Inflation Protection, Inflation Control, whatever it is act – does nothing of the sort. This bill would raise taxes on nearly every income bracket in America. It would increase taxes on those Americans who make less than $10,000 a year. I represent a lot of those Americans. Now, the Democrats have for generations now styled themselves as defenders of the working man, guardians, people of modest means. This is so ill-advised. This is frankly, this is punitive to the least among us in this country. And it's more than that. The median household income in the state of Indiana is $58,000. Under this plan, families in that income range in my state will see their taxes increase by $2 billion next year alone. I'm here for those families. I'm speaking on behalf of those families. They're upset. They find this absolutely absurd. We are the most manufacturing intensive state in the country. As we've already heard this legislation will slam our manufacturers. This is an anti-Indiana bill. Anti-Indiana. We just passed a really important piece of competitiveness legislation to ensure that we can outgrow, out-innovate, and outcompete the Chinese Communist Party. We do that with one hand and on the other hand, we have a Democrat-led Senate, House, and White House advancing an initiative that will, in fairly short order, undermine our national competitiveness. I offered an amendment to last year's [budget resolution] – the Not One Penny in Taxes Raised Amendment. The objective here was to ensure that we got everyone on record and ensure that everyone was going to register formally, in the light of day, their views about whether or not we should increase taxes on Americans – those who make $400,000 or less per year. President Biden and [Vice President] Kamala Harris, over the course of the campaign on 60 different occasions, promised there would be no increase in tax burden for Americans who make $400,000 a year or less. Well, folks, Democrats are trying to ram through legislation this week that puts a $16.7 billion tax burden on that same cohort of Americans. So, here we are again. We will continue to argue against, we will fight against, this ill-advised public policy. We can only hope that this year's bill suffers the same fate as last year's. "

Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11) and is cosponsored by 64 members, including Indiana delegation members Reps. Trey Hollingsworth (IN-09) and Greg Pence (IN-06). “The Hoosier state is fortunate enough to have two routes of the American Discovery Trail (ADT) to provide hikers and bicyclists a great outdoor adventure through both northern and southern Indiana,” said Senator Young. “I’m glad to join my colleagues to recognize the importance of this trail which connects small towns, cities, and historical sites at no cost to the taxpayer.” “The American Discovery Trail connects trails in state parks and federal lands with county roads in rural areas and sidewalks in towns and communities from coast to coast,” said Senator Coons. “I am a strong believer in the value of trails and what they represent: recreation for families, friends, and individuals, tourism and economic development for local parks and towns, and the opportunity to connect communities with the outdoors. Making the American Discovery Trail part of the National Trails system will help more Americans find and enjoy this unique network of trails, which begins in Delaware at the Cape Henlopen State Park.” “Volunteers are a driving force for conservation and play a vital role in preserving and restoring our land,” said Senator Mike Braun. “I’m proud to introduce legislation with Sen. Coons and Sen. Young to create the first coast-to-coast trail and empower volunteer groups to designate and maintain trails of regional significance in the Hoosier State and across the country!” The 1968 National Trails System Act created a framework for a national network of connected scenic, historic, and recreational trails. Today, the National Trails System includes eight National Scenic Trails, 15 National Historic Trails, and more than 1000 National Recreational Trails. However, it does not include any trail linking the network from coast to coast. The National Discovery Trails Act would create a new category within the National Trails System for long-distance trails that connect urban areas with outdoor resources, public lands, rural areas, and other communities. The bill would designate the American Discovery Trail the first of this new category of “Discovery Trails.”"

The PACT Act will provide new and important benefits to thousands of veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances. The bill also includes authorization for a new medical lease in Lawrence, Indiana, which will help our Hoosier veterans receive better service. “While I support this bill, I am disappointed that Senate Democrats rejected an amendment to fix a budget gimmick issue included in the legislation. I voted for an amendment to fix this issue, because I believe this fix would help ensure the PACT Act’s ultimate success. ""When this bill becomes law, oversight will be essential. We must not allow the presumptions of exposure that are extended under this legislation to overwhelm the VA system. The VA must be provided with the resources necessary to prevent any veteran covered under this legislation from waiting for care,"" said Senator Young.The legislation passed the Senate 86 to 11. The bipartisan legislation will expand health care for post-9/11 combat veterans, create a framework for the establishment of future presumptions of service connection related to toxic exposure, expand the VA’s list of service presumptions, and improve resources to support VA’s claims processing. Senator Young previously voted for this bill in June. Due to technical errors in the version he voted for and the Senate passed in June, the bill had to be approved again by Congress, allowing for an opportunity to improve the bill via amendments. "

We must work to protect our law enforcement as they protect our communities, which is exactly what these two bills will accomplish. I’m glad the entire Senate unanimously agreed to advance these important bills and I call on the House to pass them quickly,” said Senator Young.  The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022 would establish mental health programs for America’s first responders who often face long-term effects from providing life-saving services in moments of crisis. The Invest to Protect Act of 2022 would make the COPS grant program at the U.S. Department of Justice more easily accessible for smaller law enforcement agencies with fewer than 200 sworn officers. These bills were voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May of this year during National Police Week. More information about the bills below:  Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022: Public safety officers, police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and 911 dispatchers are at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) than the general public due to their proximity to stressful, graphic, and life-threatening situations in their job.   The Fighting PTSD Act of 2022 would require the Attorney General, in conjunction with the Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS), to propose a program to Congress for making state-of-the-art treatment available to public safety officers dealing with job-related post-traumatic stress disorder.   The legislation builds on Senator Young’s previous efforts to support public safety officers. Senator Young was the lead Republican sponsor of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which required the Department of Justice (DOJ) to produce a report on how mental health practices implemented by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs might apply to law enforcement. The legislation was signed into law in January 2018 and DOJ’s report was released in March 2019. More bill information here. Invest to Protect Act of 2022: Ninety percent of law enforcement agencies in the U.S. are smaller than 200 full-time sworn officers. These small agencies protect and serve our communities with strained budgets and a growing need for additional training, equipment, and funding.   The Invest to Protect Act of 2022 would establish a grant through the COPS program that would be limited to local law enforcement agencies with fewer than 200 sworn officers. The bill further requires that the grant application take no longer than 30 minutes to complete, so applicants can spend their time protecting their communities instead of navigating bureaucratic red tape. Through the creation of this new grant, in addition to the existing COPS grant opportunities, these smaller yet vital agencies would have greater access to federal resources to keep our officers and communities safe. "

It is time to prioritize connectivity and the subsequent adoption of digital governance to shape regional norms and provide an alternative to restrictive policies promoted by our adversaries like China. As the U.S. is positioned to lead in the digital space, our resolution encourages American leadership on digital trade rules in order to secure 21st century opportunities for Hoosiers, small businesses, manufacturers, and domestic service industries.” “As the digital economy increasingly drives growth and innovation across the globe, the United States has an opportunity to lead the world in establishing rules of the road for digital trade. Digital trade has the potential to uplift workers and spur innovation, while at the same time advancing our shared values of democracy, privacy, and the rule of law,” said Senator Carper. “I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan, bicameral resolution advocating for the United States to work with our allies across the globe to establish forward-looking global digital trade policies—so that workers and businesses in the First State and across our nation can continue to grow and thrive.” In 2020, U.S. exports of digital services surpassed $520 billion, accounting for more than half of all U.S. services exports and generating a digital services trade surplus of $214 billion. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand and reliance on digital technologies and services, data flows, and e-commerce has only increased. Accordingly, the resolution calls for the U.S. to “negotiate strong, inclusive, forward-looking, and enforceable rules on digital trade and the digital economy with like-minded countries as part of a broader trade and economic strategy to address digital barriers and ensure that the United States values of democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech, human and worker rights, privacy, and a free and open internet are at the very core of the digital world and advanced technology.”  In addition to Senators Young and Carper, the resolution was cosponsored by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas). A companion, bipartisan resolution led by Representatives Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), and Ami Bera (D-Calif.) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. A copy of the resolution can be found here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-statement-on-passage-of-china-competitiveness-legislation,"WASHINGTON –– U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) issued the following statement after the Senate passed his China competitiveness legislation:  “It’s time to go on the offensive, and that is exactly what this legislation, which has gone by many names – from the Endless Frontier Act to the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act to CHIPS-Plus – will do,” said Senator Young. “This bill will unleash private sector innovation while significantly boosting federal national security investments. It’s been a long journey to get to this point, but history will show that by passing this bill, we are confronting the challenges of today and building a prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans.” The legislation passed the Senate 64 to 33 and now heads to the House of Representatives for immediate consideration. Young first introduced the legislation in 2020 and has been working to pass it since then. Young spoke on the Senate floor about the legislation earlier today. To view his full remarks, click here. Final legislative text is available here, in addition to summaries for the CHIPS and ORAN section, the research and science section, and the energy section. Key provisions from the original Endless Frontier Act were maintained in the final version of this bill, including national security investments in key technology areas and the establishment of regional technology hubs. Senator Young’s full remarks as prepared for delivery: Mr. President, when it comes to America, I’m an optimist. Always. I can’t help but approach the future with great hope. After all, as Americans, we have never let obstacles stand in our way, or accepted that problems can’t be solved. Our citizens are the world’s most ingenious, our military its mightiest, our economy the strongest, and our innovators the most creative. The last century was defined by our accomplishments and ideals, and I believe this one will be too. But this path is not guaranteed. Now, as then, America’s success depends on unleashing the potential of our people and outcompeting and out-innovating global rivals who do not share our values or economic interests. Right now, we are in the middle of a great power competition with an authoritarian regime in Beijing that seeks global primacy and rejects democracy. The Chinese Communist Party is currently investing $1.4 trillion in frontier technologies that will dominate the 21st century – artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and hypersonics, among other key technologies. Its innovators are earning patents and publishing research in AI at a greater rate than our own. Its schools are producing four times the STEM graduates as America’s, and the CCP’s computer and science universities are regularly outranking ours.   Its military is making advances in cyberwarfare and the development of hypersonic weapons, autonomous vehicles, electronic and cyber warfare, and orbital bombardment systems. These are the technologies that will dominate the 21st century, economically and militarily. China’s government is planning on winning the AI race, winning future wars, and winning the future. And the truth is, Beijing is well on its way to accomplishing these goals. America is at risk of falling behind economically and technologically to a world power that does not value liberty or even respect human life.  So how should we respond?  For too long, when it comes to Chinese aggression, America has relied on a strategy of deterrence – taking steps like blocking Huawei from doing business in the U.S., tightening export controls and improving foreign investment rules. These are important measures, but no longer enough. It’s time to go on the offensive. And that is exactly what this legislation, which has gone by many names – from the Endless Frontier Act to the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act to CHIPS-Plus – will do. Unleash private sector innovation while significantly boosting federal national security investments. Let me highlight a few specifics. First, this bill greatly encourages domestic investment in semiconductor production. Right now, the United States of America is almost entirely reliant on other nations for the high-tech computer chips that power our smart phones, automobiles, household appliances, and military platforms. The recent shortage of these chips has hobbled our economy and hit our pocketbooks. For example, a shortage of computer chips forced General Motors to idle its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana twice this year. U.S. semiconductor production, once accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world’s supply, has dropped to just 12 percent, while China’s production share is increasing. Ninety percent of the chips used in our military technology are made overseas. Most are made in South Korea and Taiwan, but an increasing number are produced in China. This is a very real economic and national security vulnerability. This bill will reassert America’s place in this industry, and take a giant leap towards ensuring that our supply chain and national defense will never be at the mercy of technology produced overseas. Another important aspect of this bill is critical applied research funding. This legislation reforms and invests in the National Science Foundation to partner with the private sector and universities to develop critical emerging technologies that will transform the global landscape. We know that national success and competitiveness in the 21st Century economy will be built on emerging technologies like quantum computing and AI. Funding research crucial to keeping Americans safe is one of the federal government’s responsibilities, and this legislation will help us not just catch up with but overtake China in these critical areas. And this bill will establish regional technology hubs across our country, which will become centers for the research, development, entrepreneurship, and manufacturing of new key technologies. This is incredibly important at a time when too many Americans in the heartland feel left out and too many areas are overlooked…when only a handful of cities account for nearly 90 percent of job growth in these advanced sectors. Simply put, this bill will make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. And it is desperately needed. How do we know? Because the Chinese Communist Party has actively lobbied against this legislation. They know this bill is bad for China and good for the United States. This bill is about securing our country, giving our people the tools to flourish, and ensuring America continues its global research role. It’s been a long journey to get to this point, but history will show that by passing this CHIPS-Plus bill, we are confronting the challenges of today and building a prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  ###"

We've done the right thing after exhausting all other opportunities. And we're passing what people are calling the CHIPS-Plus bill, [which] includes investment in domestic capacity to produce those computer chips, which go into everything with an on-off switch, everything from an automobile to top-end missile systems. Also, we're doubling down on some key national security research investments in areas like hypersonics, where the Chinese, frankly, are outclassing us, and we can't allow that to happen.”--- “Ronald Reagan was fond of saying that defense is not a budget issue. You spend what you need to defend to spend to keep the American people safe. The same thing applies here. This is a national security investment, as I've already established, and we need to spend it to keep our people safe and secure.” The full video of the interview can be found here."

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-discusses-housing-crisis-legislation-to-increase-affordable-housing-nationwide,"WASHINGTON –– During a Senate Finance Committee hearing yesterday, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) discussed the impact of the affordable housing crisis on Indiana communities and the importance of passing the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act he introducedwith Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).  Senator Young shared concerns from Hoosiers about the affordable housing crisis. “I have to tell you, as I travel across the state of Indiana, I hear from every community about the importance of affordable housing and about the challenges they are experiencing right now,” said Senator Young. “This shortage is of course being exacerbated by the current inflation challenges more broadly impacting the country.” Senator Young’s Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act would expand and strengthen the nation’s most successful affordable housing program—the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)—to address that shortage by building more than two million new affordable units over the next decade and ensuring the program better serves a variety of at-risk and underserved communities. “We can rally around solving difficult challenges together,” said Senator Young. “This housing affordability crisis, it’s striking how it impacts various demographic groups, geographic areas. It doesn’t really seem to discriminate a lot. The brunt of this crisis falls on a diverse population. It’s so important we support programs and ideas that meet the needs of these variedcommunities.”The full video of the hearing can be found here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-discusses-fentanyls-impact-on-indiana-communities,"WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) spoke at a press conference about how problems at our southern border are affecting law enforcement officers in Indiana and across the country. Senator Young also discussed the impact of the drug fentanyl on Hoosiers.  Excerpts from Senator Young’s remarks are below:  “According to the National Center for Health Statistics, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses during the pandemic’s first year. 100,000 Americans. That’s double the figure from 2015, and more than were killed in car crashes and gun fatalities.“A huge contributor to that number, we know, is the drug fentanyl, most of the supplies of fentanyl comes across our southwestern border. It’s usually laced into another drug, so people have no idea what they're taking it until it's too late.“But don’t take my word for it. Let me share how this crisis is affecting Hoosiers.“When discussing fentanyl overdoses, the sheriff in Brown County said: ‘The toll it takes on the community is terrible and continues to get worse.’“A representative from the LaPorte County coroner’s office told my staff about the prevalence of fentanyl in the drug-related cases. She said this substance has been associated with approximately 98% of all drug overdose deaths in the county.“In Marion County, where Indianapolis is located, they had 641 fentanyl deaths in 2021. The coroner in my home county, Johnson County, reports 95% of their drug overdoses that led to deaths involve fentanyl.“Earlier this week, the police department in Plainfield, Indiana announced a substantial fentanyl drug bust and issued a warning, calling it a ‘very serious, addictive and deadly drug’ that the police department has seen firsthand destroy families and communities.”--- “We have to secure the border. The surge in illegal border crossings over the past year has forced Customs and Border Protection to shift resources away from drug interdiction to processing migrants.” To watch Senator Young’s remarks, click here."

So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.“Given our increased knowledge and understanding of how babies develop, this is simply the wrong direction to take public policy.“I also want to take a moment and acknowledge that the issue of abortion is a tough one for many Americans.“And given recent developments, this is a topic on the minds of many Hoosiers and many Americans.“I want to reiterate my commitment to helping mothers and families choose life and supporting them in that choice.“We must ensure mothers and unborn children are cared for, loved, and supported, and this includes increasing the resources available to help women facing unexpected pregnancies.“We must support America’s 2,700 pregnancy centers that provide vital services to millions of people each year at virtually no cost, as well as provide more support for adoptive services.“These steps are vital as we seek to further promote a culture that values and protects life. “Let’s remember and live up to that founding American ideal – we believe in the dignity and value of every human person.”The full speech is available here."

In an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 90 to 5, the Senate passed a bipartisan motion offered by Senators Young and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to promote American research and development. The motion supports expanding the research and development tax credit for small businesses and preserving the ability of innovative U.S. companies to fully deduct R&D investments. In remarks on the Senate floor, Senator Young said, “We cannot compete with China without robust domestic R&D. A company investing $100 in R&D in China this year would get a $200 deduction. In America? That company investing $100 would only get to deduct $10 this year. We must not lose out on innovation and production to China.” Senator Hassan also spoke on the Senate floor and said, “The research and development tax credit gives critical support to the small businesses and start-ups that power our economy. By strengthening the R&D tax credit for startups and preserving other tax incentives for research here in America, we can outcompete countries like China.” Watch Senator Young’s floor remarks here. Last night’s motion follows Senators Young and Hassan’s ongoing efforts to support research and development. They previously introduced the bipartisan American Innovation and Jobs Act to restore incentives for long-term R&D investment by ensuring that companies can continue to fully deduct R&D expenses each year. The bill would also double the refundable R&D tax credit and expand it to more startups and small businesses."

It's the state of our economy. It's what people increasingly are calling the ‘Biden economy’ back home. One national poll indicated where things are headed. It indicated that 94 percent of Americans say they are upset or concerned about inflation. 94 percent. We remain in so many respects a divided nation, and when the President of the United States stood on the steps of the United States Capitol and said he wanted to unite America, I didn't believe he was going to unite America around the notion that we are on the wrong economic track.”--- “Inflation's costing Americans an average of $327 per month. Now, I don't know how much $327 is to Joe Biden, but for the average Hoosier family, that’s a lot. It's a whole lot. They're being hit by rising energy, grocery bills, rent prices. It's out of control. And it's people of modest means who are being hit the hardest. It's senior citizens on fixed incomes.” To watch the Senator’s remarks, click here. "

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-colleagues-to-urge-commerce-secretary-raimondo-to-reconsider-russias-status-as-a-market-economy,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and a bipartisan group of colleaguesin a letterurging Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to reconsider Russia’s status as a market economy within the meaning of the anti-dumping (AD) law of the Tariff Act of 1930.  Although the Commerce Department classified Russia as a market economy in 2002, Russia has backslid in recent years towards less and less of a free market economy. Now after its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has taken further steps to centralize control over the Russian economy. Classifying Russia as a non-market economy would likely increase the anti-dumping duties on Russia in future AD cases. “Russia imposes restrictions on eight of the eleven types of capital transactions tracked by the International Monetary Fund, and since Russia’s invasion, the conversion of the ruble has become only more difficult. Recently, the Central Bank of Russia announced it will prevent banks from selling foreign currency to Russians and limit how much foreign currency individuals can withdraw from their accounts.These edicts are explicitly designed to restrict access to foreign currency,” said the senators. The senators continued,“Russia’s economy is also marked by government ownership and control over production. According to Russian government sources, the state’s share in the Russian economy may be as high as 70 percent.This growth of economic intervention by the Russian government tracks the rapid expansion of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Russia. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia has the third most SOEs per capita in the world.” Senators Young and Portman were joined by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio),James Lankford (R-Okla.),Mike Braun (R-Ind.),Angus S. King Jr. (I-Maine), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Ark.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). You can read the full letter hereand below: Dear Secretary Raimondo,  We write to urge you to reconsider Russia’s status as a market economy within the meaning of the anti-dumping (AD) law of the Tariff Act of 1930. In light of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, as well as the facts on the Russian economy, we ask that you reexamine this issue and find that Russia is a non-market economy country. Over the past two decades, Russia has regressed from a fledgling market economy to one without a free market. In its 2002 decision classifying Russia as a market economy, the Department of Commerce noted that economic decentralization was the “hallmark of market economies.” Yet, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, Russia has become marked by corruption, weak rule of law, worker exploitation, and human rights violations. When the facts of this backsliding are applied to the relevant statutory criteria, there is no doubt that Russia should be classified as a non-market economy country. Of the six statutory criteria for determining whether a country is a non-market economy, we believe it important, and dispositive, to highlight two in particular: currency convertibility and state control over the economy. It is clear that the ruble is not freely convertible into the currency of other countries. Russia imposes restrictions on eight of the eleven types of capital transactions tracked by the International Monetary Fund, and since Russia’s invasion, the conversion of the ruble has become only more difficult. Recently, the Central Bank of Russia announced it will prevent banks from selling foreign currency to Russians and limit how much foreign currency individuals can withdraw from their accounts. These edicts are explicitly designed to restrict access to foreign currency. Russia’s economy is also marked by government ownership and control over production. According to Russian government sources, the state’s share in the Russian economy may be as high as 70 percent. This growth of economic intervention by the Russian government tracks the rapid expansion of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Russia. According to the International Monetary Fund, Russia has the third most SOEs per capita in the world. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—a repugnant latest step in its year’s long campaign to undermine order and democracy in Eastern Europe—has earned it a unique status as an international scofflaw. Therefore, we would strongly encourage the administration to use this opportunity to hold the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putin accountable for its continued attempt to circumvent international norms, economic or otherwise, to their own benefit. Specifically, we note that pursuant to the antidumping law, the Department of Commerce “may make a determination [of non-market economy status] at any time.”  We believe that time is now and that the facts clearly support this reclassification. Thank you for considering our request, and we appreciate your attention to this important matter. Sincerely,"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-discusses-usica-regional-technology-hubs-with-commerce-secretary,"WASHINGTON – During a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) discussed the importance of his United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) and regional technology hubs with Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.Senator Young shared his perspective on the overall importance of passing the USICA.“Sometimes people try and figure out how to characterize this legislation. Is it innovation legislation? Is it a China competitiveness bill? You know, there's a happy coincidence between the two. And if we can harness the talent, the energies, the entrepreneurial spirit, the broad, deep capital markets of the United States of America…and become more innovative, there's no doubt in my mind that we’re going to win the 21st century for American values. So they are really one. They're two sides of the same coin,” said Senator Young.Secretary Raimondo discussed how technology hubs can help create ecosystems of innovation in communities around the country.“For example, in the Midwest, there are fantastic research universities. I think Purdue just launched a whole new program for semiconductor master's programs. So what we want to do is in regions around the country, bring together research institutions with entrepreneurs, with companies, to take the great ideas coming out of the research institutions and translate them into products that we can make,” said Secretary Raimondo.The full conversation is available here."

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-rubio-colleagues-urge-cfius-review-of-alphawave-acquisition-of-us-semiconductor-ip-company,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Marco Rubio (R–Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), and John Cornyn (R-Texas) sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen regarding Chinese-funded Alphawave IP Group’s intent to acquire U.S.-based semiconductor IP developer OpenFive.  “The Communist Chinese Party continues its aggressive attempts to acquire U.S.-based technology, particularly for semiconductors. The Biden Administration must use the tools Congress has given it to protect our country from these subversive efforts,” said Senator Young regarding the letter. Alphawave, which touts its extensive business in China, is backed by Wise Road Capital, a Beijing-based private equity firm propped up by the Chinese Communist Party. The senators urged the Treasury Department to conduct a Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) review of the OpenFive acquisition. “The OpenFive acquisition would nearly double the number of connectivity-focused IPs available to Alphawave customers, as well as accelerate Alphawave’s roadmap for advanced connectivity solutions,” the senators wrote. “[I]t would also risk undermining U.S. trade and export policies given the strong possibility that Alphawave would redeploy OpenFive’s IP outside the U.S. That would mean furnishing Chinese semiconductor companies with advanced IP developed through U.S. technology, thus enabling the CCP to develop next-generation products in advanced semiconductor processes. Such an effort would impact U.S. national security interests, particularly given Alphawave’s continued access to U.S. technologies, as well as its use of joint domiciles outside the U.S. and beyond the jurisdiction of American export controls.” The full text of the letter is below.  Dear Secretary Yellen: It has come to my/our attention that Alphawave IP Group, a London- and Toronto-based, Chinese-funded developer of semiconductor intellectual property (IP) used in the design of advanced-node Integrated Circuits (IC), has announced its intent to acquire U.S.-based OpenFive, a leading developer of system-on-chip (SoC) intellectual property (IP). I/we write to convey my/our strong concern with this announcement, given Alphawave’s dependence on Chinese-based financing, its role as a key supplier of critical semiconductor IP to China, and the strong possibility that an acquisition would mean sharing state-of-the-art IC design tools from U.S. companies with Chinese entities. As such, I/we urge a Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) review of the OpenFive acquisition. One of Alphawave’s key commercial focuses is to provide cutting-edge semiconductor IP to the Chinese market, contributing directly to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) Made In China 2025 industrial plan and implicating U.S. national security interests as a result. Alphawave’s access to the Chinese market is facilitated through two particular China-based “Product Partnerships.” These impart significant financial value to Alphawave, with combined initial licensing fees reaching approximately $150 million – accounting for three-quarters of the company’s bookings in a recent financial disclosure, according to the Financial Times – and are poised to play a firm’s role in the company’s ongoing efforts to “drive further success in China.” One of Alphawave’s two product partners, Verisilicon Microelectronics, is the largest IC design-services company based in China. Another is Wise Road Capital, a Beijing-based private equity fund backed by a combination of private and state entities. Wise Road reportedly enjoys a 10 percent stake in Alphawave, as well as an agreement to license Alphawave’s IP to Chinese companies to develop ICs containing Alphawave’s advanced semiconductor design IP. Wise Road also exhibits a concerning pattern of cultivating investments and ownership stakes in non-Chinese semiconductor enterprises, acquiring their cutting-edge assets and IP, and, in most cases, then relocating them to China. This behavior attracted CFIUS’s attention last year, when, in March 2021, Wise Road attempted to purchase Korean-based Magnachip Semiconductor Corp.   Wise Road backed away from this deal after failing to secure approval from CFIUS, which cited “risks to the national security of the United States” that would result from the transaction. CFIUS was right to raise these concerns. Wise Road is positioned to transfer and license cutting-edge semiconductor IP, including IP produced or acquired by Alphawave, to a wide range of customers in China whose identities and activities cannot be monitored reliably. Thus, products using this IP would form the foundation of a leading-edge, indigenous supply chain in China to power the CCP’s efforts in 5G, data networking, supercomputing, and other critical industries. The downstream recipients of this technology would be nearly impossible to track, and federal regulators would likely struggle to establish which are on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List or subject to other restrictions. Now, I/we urge CFIUS to apply the same level of scrutiny to Alphawave’s proposed acquisition of OpenFive, in light of Wise Road’s equity investment in Alphawave and its arrangement to license Alphawave’s advanced semiconductor IP – including OpenFive’s system-on-chip IP – to Chinese private and state users. The OpenFive acquisition would nearly double the number of connectivity-focused IPs available to Alphawave customers, as well as accelerate Alphawave’s roadmap for advanced connectivity solutions. As with the Wise Road-Magnachip case, it would also risk undermining U.S. trade and export policies given the strong possibility that Alphawave would redeploy OpenFive’s IP outside the U.S. That would mean furnishing Chinese semiconductor companies with advanced IP developed through U.S. technology, thus enabling the CCP to develop next-generation products in advanced semiconductor processes. Such an effort would impact U.S. national security interests, particularly given Alphawave’s continued access to U.S. technologies, as well as its use of joint domiciles outside the U.S. and beyond the jurisdiction of American export controls. For these reasons, I/we urge CFIUS to conduct a review of Alphawave’s OpenFive acquisition. Should it do so, I/we also request that the Committee carefully scrutinize Alphawave’s business and investor relationships, as well as its current business strategies and their impact on U.S. export control laws and broader U.S. national security interests. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely,"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-van-hollen-urge-administration-to-engage-with-lebanon-to-support-on-time-free-and-fair-parliamentary-elections,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) sent a bipartisan letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the Administration to engage with Lebanon to ensure fairness and transparency in its upcoming parliamentary elections on May 15. In light of the ongoing political, economic, and health crises in Lebanon, Senators Young and Van Hollen stressed the importance of maintaining the scheduled elections and ensuring they are conducted with integrity.  The senators begin, “We write to ask you to engage with your counterparts in Lebanon and urge them to hold parliamentary elections scheduled for May 15 on time and in a fair and transparent manner. These polls can be a critical first step to restoring legitimacy to Lebanon’s political process and laying the foundation for enacting critical economic reforms. And yet, concerns remain that some officials may seek to postpone the upcoming elections in an attempt to preserve their own political power.”  “As you know, Lebanon has been enduring interrelated political, economic, and health crises since at least 2019, when hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets to protest against political elites widely seen as responsible for decades of corruption and mismanagement,” they note. “The importance of Lebanon proceeding with these parliamentary elections on time cannot be understated. This vote will be the first since the popular uprising in October 2019 and would be a critical step to restoring confidence and stability in Lebanon’s political process. We ask you to engage with your Lebanese counterparts to urge them to proceed with these elections on May 15, with appropriate funding allocated, and in a fair and transparent manner,” they conclude. The full text of the letter is below. Dear Secretary Blinken:  We write to ask you to engage with your counterparts in Lebanon and urge them to hold parliamentary elections scheduled for May 15 on time and in a fair and transparent manner. These polls can be a critical first step to restoring legitimacy to Lebanon’s political process and laying the foundation for enacting critical economic reforms. And yet, concerns remain that some officials may seek to postpone the upcoming elections in an attempt to preserve their own political power.  As you know, Lebanon has been enduring interrelated political, economic, and health crises since at least 2019, when hundreds of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets to protest against political elites widely seen as responsible for decades of corruption and mismanagement. Protests and ensuing political gridlock resulted in the lack of a functioning national government from October 2019 to September 2021. A deadly explosion at the port of Beirut on August 4, 2020 killed more than 200 people and injured and displaced thousands. As a result of the ongoing financial crisis, Lebanon’s currency has lost more than 90 percent of its value since 2019 and more than 75 percent of the country’s population is living in poverty. Shortages of medicine, water, food, and fuel—compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—are further complicating efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic and a severe energy shortage. While there are important efforts underway to increase Lebanon’s energy supply and implement necessary financial reforms, upcoming parliamentary elections that restore popular legitimacy to the government will be essential to implementing the structural reforms Lebanon needs. Against this backdrop, in December 2021, Lebanon’s Interior Ministry scheduled its parliamentary elections for May 15, 2022. On February 4, 2022, the United Nations Security Council emphasized “the importance of holding free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections as scheduled on 15 May 2022, ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women as candidates and voters in the election, and called on the Government of Lebanon to enable the Supervisory Commission for Elections to carry out its mandate, notably by providing it with adequate resources and initiating the process of nominating candidates.” On February 15, Lebanon’s government approved the allocation of $18 million to hold the parliamentary elections – a positive step, although concerns remain that some officials may yet seek to use the country’s financial crisis as a pretext to postpone the vote. The importance of Lebanon proceeding with these parliamentary elections on time cannot be understated. This vote will be the first since the popular uprising in October 2019 and would be a critical step to restoring confidence and stability in Lebanon’s political process. We ask you to engage with your Lebanese counterparts to urge them to proceed with these elections on May 15, with appropriate funding allocated, and in a fair and transparent manner. Thank you for your attention to this timely issue. Sincerely,"

The other day, [the Senator] said the administration’s efforts to roll back Title 42 ‘shows a lack of understanding about the crisis at our border.’”--- “Immigration officials have warned that letting Title 42 expire will make our border crisis three times worse. Three times worse.”--- “We know what needs to be done. The Administration needs to stop playing games. They need to do what is right for the country. They need to enforce the law. And they need to do what a bipartisan majority of United States senators is now calling for. Keep Title 42 in place and secure our border.”  To watch Senator Young’s full remarks, click here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-discusses-ukraine-on-cnns-the-lead,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today joined The Lead on CNN to discuss the latest developments on the situation in Ukraine. Click here or the image above to watch. Partial Transcript: Young on change in the Biden administration’s tone: “To the extent the change in tone has been that we are actually going to help the Ukrainians win this war as opposed to lose slowly, I think that's been very positive. I think the weakened state of the Russian economy, the Russian military, and the Russian state’s diplomatic respect in the world will take care of itself. It will be a byproduct of our unified efforts in the West to ensure that we properly resource Ukrainians and help see them through to a victory.” Young on the possibility of a peace deal: “I don't want to overstate the extent to which it will make less possible a peace deal. I do think that we should be a lot more focused in our public statements (on) doing whatever it takes to ensure that Ukrainians win militarily. And we also need to be focused on ensuring that the United States is perceived as in this to stay, in this for the long haul. And one way we can do that through concrete measures, as opposed to things behind podiums, would be to ensure that we are able to get in place the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine as soon as possible. Open that embassy back up. “We heard from Secretary of State Blinken before the Foreign Relations Committee today that there are now diplomats on the ground in Lviv investigating how to make that happen. But we ought to bring that that nominee to a vote so that we have an ambassador in place ASAP. “And then when it comes to resourcing the Ukrainians, currently, Jake, it takes 72 hours between the request for certain material to be sent and for that to be delivered. We ought to be identifying ways to expedite that. There's a piece of legislation over in the House of Representatives that would reconstitute a form of (the) Lend-Lease program that could compress that timeline somewhat. And lastly, we really need to be pressing our European allies, who've been on balance pretty good so far. But we need to press them to provide whatever Russian material, Russian armaments, they have that the Ukrainians already know how to use. And we can get into their hands. You know, as I colloquially say from time to time, if it shoots, we ought to be sending it.” Young on Rep. Victoria Spartz’s call for U.S. military attaché presence as part of a returning diplomatic redeployment to Ukraine: “One would think this would be done in conjunction with reopening the embassy. So the proper sequencing is immediately let's vote on the ambassador, let's open the embassy, and then let's locate a defense attaché at that facility or in the country operating out of that embassy. But I do agree with Congresswoman Spartz, who incidentally has shown incredible leadership on behalf of her own constituents and the broader Ukrainian American diaspora.” "

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-re-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-protect-families-from-lead-in-federally-assisted-housing,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) re-introduced their bipartisan legislation to protect families living in assisted housing from lead found in drinking water. The Get the Lead Out of Assisted Housing Act would help protect families from lead exposure by requiring the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to inspect for lead service lines, create a grant program to address lead contamination and allow a cross-check for lead in water when remediating a home for lead found in paint. “Families shouldn’t have to face the threat of lead contamination in their drinking water or in their homes,” said Senator Young. “That’s why we are reintroducing our bipartisan Get Lead Out of Assisted Housing Act to require HUD to identify and address lead contamination at the source. This must happen to protect the health of Hoosier families and communities across the country.”  “It’s unacceptable that in one of the wealthiest nations in the world, families living in federally assisted housing remain at risk of suffering permanent brain damage as a result of drinking water contaminated with lead,” said Senator Duckworth. “With my Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act fully authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re already taking historic strides to get the lead out of our drinking water in communities across the country and help make sure everyone has access to clean water. Today’s bipartisan legislation would build on this progress and help ensure no family is overlooked.” Along with Senators Young and Duckworth, this legislation is also co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). The Get the Lead Out of Assisted Housing Act would help protect families from lead exposure by:  The copy of the bill text can be found here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-helps-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-bill-reforming-opportunity-zones,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act to reform Opportunity Zones, the tax incentive for individuals who reinvest unrealized capital gains into high-impact projects in underserved communities.  “The creation of the Opportunity Zones initiative in the 2017 tax reform law has succeeded in attracting capital and investments to historically distressed communities. They serve as a critical tool to create jobs, revitalize neighborhoods, and lift Hoosiers out of poverty, which is why I am proud to help introduce the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act. This bipartisan legislation will better optimize Opportunity Zone investment in neighborhoods and communities across Indiana while strengthening transparency and reporting metrics to improve on the initiative’s success,” said Senator Young. “The Opportunity Zone incentive has the potential to unleash much-needed economic growth in high poverty communities across the country – communities that investors too often overlook. But without robust guardrails in place, the incentive could be undermined or abused by those who aren’t committed to uplifting rural and urban communities across the country,” said Senator Booker. “I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Scott to help restore the original promise of opportunity zones by steering private capital to reinvest in underserved communities that have been historically left behind and working to level the economic playing field.” “The Opportunity Zone program represents the good that leaders can do for communities across the country when we work together toward common sense solutions,” said Senator Scott. “Independent reporting shows that investments in Opportunity Zones are making a huge impact across the country, with billions of dollars flowing into impoverished neighborhoods. I am glad to build on that success with this legislation to make the program stronger, so that we can ensure this incentive is benefitting the Americans who need it most.” This bipartisan legislation would improve Opportunity Zones by: Representatives Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), and Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) co-sponsored the legislation in the House. The full text of the legislation can be viewed here.    Quotes in support of the legislation can be viewed below: John Lettieri, President and CEO, Economic Innovation Group: “Supporting economic growth in low-income communities remains an urgent challenge as the country recovers from the severe disruption of the pandemic. One powerful way to do that is to strengthen the Opportunity Zones incentive, which has proven to be an effective tool for encouraging investment in struggling areas throughout the country,” said John Lettieri, President and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group. “The Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act would enhance the policy on multiple fronts, including by enacting careful reporting and measurement standards, strengthening the incentive to draw in greater investment, creating new ways to attract funding for high-impact activities, and refining the map of designated communities to better align with the intent of the law. EIG applauds the bill’s sponsors for their thoughtful, bipartisan leadership in bringing this important legislation to fruition.”     Rick Wade, Senior Vice President, U.S. Chamber of Commerce: “The Opportunity Zone program is a positive, compelling example of government and the private sector working together to solve our nation's challenges. Investments made possible through the Opportunity Zone program will help underserved communities struggling to bounce back from pandemic-induced economic hardships. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is proud to support this bipartisan legislation that ensures Opportunity Zone financing reaches the areas of our country that need it the most and expands the reach of a public-private partnership on track to decrease the poverty rate by 11 percent,” said Rick Wade, Senior Vice President at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Katie Kramer, Vice President, Council of Development Finance Agencies: “The Council of Development Finance Agencies is grateful to Congress for their efforts to introduce important reforms to Opportunity Zones. The State and Community Dynamism Fund is critically needed at the local levels to fully deploy comprehensive OZ strategies in disinvested communities. We stand ready to support the implementation of the Opportunity Zones Transparency, Extension, and Improvement Act.” "

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-grassley-introduce-bill-to-help-first-responders-cope-with-stresses-of-serving-communities-in-moments-of-crisis,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) along with a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to help police, fire, emergency medical, and 911 personnel cope with the stresses of responding to crisis situations. The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Act of 2022 would establish mental health programs for America’s first responders who often face long-term effects from providing life-saving services in moments of crisis.  The legislation builds on Senator Young’s previous efforts to support public safety officers. Senator Young was the lead Republican sponsor of the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which required the Department of Justice (DOJ) to produce a report on how mental health practices implemented by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs might apply to law enforcement. The legislation was signed into lawin January 2018 and DOJ’s reportwas released in March 2019. Building on that work, the Fighting PTSD Act would require DOJ to develop a program that could administer state-of-the-art PTSD treatments to public safety officers across the country.  ""Our first responders put their lives on the line every day to ensure the safety and security of Hoosier families. Their work is high-pressure, often resulting in both seen and unseen injuries, and we must provide them with the support they need. This critical legislation would increase the resources available to public safety officers dealing with job-related post-traumatic stress disorder. Increasing this support to our public safety officers will lead to healthier and stronger communities across Indiana and our country,” said Senator Young. “In times of crisis, we count on first responders and dispatchers to deliver life-saving aid – often at their own exposure to tremendous risk. Beyond the physical scars, this essential service can also take a mental and emotional toll. This bill takes the first step to ensuring that the brave individuals who respond in critical situations have access to mental health services needed to manage stress, stay healthy and continue to serve our communities,” said Senator Grassley. Police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians,and 911 dispatchers routinely encounter high-stress situations, putting them at risk of developing PTSD, which increases the risk of suicide. The Fighting PTSD Actwould require DOJ to establish evidence-based treatment programs for first responders across the country, similar to services available to military personnel who develop PTSD or acute stress disorders. The bill requires DOJ to consult with stakeholders, including public safety officer organizations, in developing the program, which would be available to serve first responders in communities of all sizes across the country.  In addition to Senators Young and Grassley, the bill is cosponsored by Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).The Fighting PTSD Actis supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD. The legislation also is supported by numerous Indiana public safety organizations:Bill Owensby, President of the Indiana Fraternal Order of Police: “It should be no secret to anyone that all of our first responders; Police, Fire, EMT and Dispatchers endure an enormous amount of stressors over their careers. As a result, medical issues, early retirement, and a surprising number of suicides plague the professions-most of it tied to PTSD. Many thanks to Senator Grassley and especially to our own Hoosier Senator Todd Young (and the other authors) in introducing this bill to help develop programs to recognize and treat PTSD in an effort to reduce the damaging effects.” Rick Snyder, President of the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police: “We are grateful for this important continued effort of Senator Young and others to address the seen and unseen injuries of our Law Enforcement Officers, Dispatchers, other frontline public safety providers and their families. So many have given so much in sacrifice for their communities. Now is the time to provide care and comfort for their wellbeing.” Steve Luce, Executive Director of the Indiana Sheriffs’ Association: “The ISA has dedicated our current training platform to address and heighten the awareness of PTSD and Suicide by implementing Wellness and Resiliency Workshops for our Law Enforcement Officers.  The Fighting PTSD Act of 2022 will allow this serious issue in the Law Enforcement Profession to be addressed properly during the career of a Law Enforcement Professional.  It is extremely important to have resources available for the officer and their families throughout their careers. One Officer Suicide is One too many.” Matthew A. Myers, Bartholomew County Sheriff: “As law enforcement officers, with boots on the ground, we are dedicated to providing caring and compassionate support. I support this bill 100% and I want to thank Senator Young for showing Hoosiers that he truly cares about each and every one of us.” Cory Martin, Executive Director at the Indiana State Police Alliance:“As findings state, it is estimated that 30% of public safety officers develop behavioral health conditions at some point in their lifetime. Our members, who are Indiana State Troopers, Motor Carrier Inspectors, and Capitol Police Officers, don’t fall short of this statistic. It is critical that we have the support of our members in Congress. By enacting this legislation, we can ensure swift and proper programming is available, should any of our members need these services. Thank you, Senator Young, for your unwavering support to Indiana's Law Enforcement community.” Thomas Hanify, President of the Professional Firefighters Union of Indiana:“The PFFUI appreciates the Senator’s efforts in dealing with mental health issues in public safety. In Indiana we have started working on this issue and getting support from the federal government would be a tremendous boost to our efforts. As Firefighters, we are trained to save lives, often at our own peril. The emotional toll being a first responder has long been overlooked, but in recent years we have begun to recognize not only the impact that it has on firefighters, but on their colleagues, families and communities. Thankfully, PTSD is a treatable condition. We commend Senator Young for addressing this critical issue and look forward to working with him to get this passed through Congress.” John Gullion, President of the Indiana Firefighters Association:“The Indiana Firefighters Association is proud to support Senator Young’s bill that provides our First Responders, nationwide, an avenue to access services to cope with job related mental health issues.”David Israel, President of the Indiana Volunteer Firefighters Association:“The Indiana Volunteer Firefighters Association with our nearly 14,000 members thanks and supports Senator Todd Young with the introduction of legislation to help and care for our members suffering from health conditions including but not limited to mental health and PTSD who are serving or have served in the fire and EMS services.” Kelly Mitchell, Indiana State Treasurer and Chair of the Indiana Statewide 911 Board:“Public Safety Telecommunicators are front line emergency operators who answer unimaginably difficult 911 calls. Until now, the immense stress of this work has often been overlooked. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Todd Young, additional resources are on the horizon for our unsung heroes. On behalf of the Indiana Statewide 911 Board, we are proud to support the Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act.”   Jason Haddix, President of the Indiana Chapter of the National Emergency Number Association: “Public safety telecommunicators are often left out when thinking about first responders. In fact, they are the first contact someone has in their time of crisis or need. Close your eyes and imagine hearing someone finding a loved one dead – those cries, those screams, that emotion, often don’t go away. Once the telecommunicator hangs up the phone there is often little closure, since outcomes are rarely provided. Once that call is over, they have to be ready for the next one. It could be anything from reports of a horrific car crash, a baby not breathing, or a caller yelling for help as their house is burning down. The Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022 is a step in the right direction to provide much-needed assistance to all first responders. The Indiana Chapter of the National Emergency Number Association Board of Directors fully support this legislation. It’s time for public safety professionals, who help so many, have easy access to get help for themselves.” Gary Miller, Executive Director of the Indiana EMS Association:“EMS agencies across Indiana as well as across the Nation work diligently to develop systems to ensure that high-quality, compassionate and life-saving care is provided to their communities. Of course the most important piece of this system is the individual EMS practitioners who are responding to assist people often on the worst day of their lives. The stresses that are inherent when you have someone’s life in your hands is extremely difficult; add to that long-hours, harsh environments, exposure to infectious diseases and all the other factors involved make it extremely difficult to find balance in the provider’s own lives. Just as EMS responds to calls for help everyday, it is great to see that Senator Young and the others are making efforts to provide needed resources when the EMS practitioners place those calls themselves.” Stephen C. McCaffrey, President and CEO of Mental Health America of Indiana:“Mental Health America of Indiana applauds the introduction of the Fighting Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Act of 2022. This legislation provides long overdue recognition that the mental well-being of those who serve people in distress is as important as the well-being of the people being served. The issues to be evaluated and reported on under this bill underscore the importance of support to responders’ family members and the significance of peer support.”"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-statement-on-biden-administration-lifting-title-42-border-policy,"WASHINGTON –Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) issued the following statement regarding the Biden administration’s announcement that as of May 23 it will no longer use Title 42, a public health policy regulation, to block illegal immigrants from entering the United States: “Despite warnings from both Republicans and Democrats about a surge in border crossings if Title 42 is lifted, the Biden administration announced it is eliminating one of the last remaining tools in our toolbox to stem the tide of illegal immigration. “In the last six months, U.S. Border Patrol had more than one million encounters with people entering the country illegally. Lifting the Title 42 order, which has been an important backstop over the last two years, ties the hands of our hard-working border patrol agents and makes their jobs even more difficult. “As one Democratic Senator from Arizona put it, this announcement ‘shows a lack of understanding about the crisis at our border.’ This is the wrong decision and will only exacerbate the already out-of-control crisis we have at our southern border.”"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-addresses-continued-inadequate-treasury-engagement-on-international-tax-negotiations,"WASHINGTON– U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Senate Finance Committee Republicans again in writing U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to highlight the lack of engagement with Congress on its international tax agreement. The senators note Treasury has consistently failed to consult Congress in any meaningful way, nor has it provided the requested data and analysis necessary for Congress to properly evaluate the effect of its agreement on the U.S. business community and U.S. revenue.   From the letter: “[T]he Assistant Secretary asserts there has been appropriate engagement through briefings provided by Treasury to certain Congressional staff. However, these briefings merely informed certain staff of negotiations after they had occurred, and in most cases, after developments were publicly announced and the corresponding documents were publicly released. After-the-fact briefings with committee and leadership staff do not constitute meaningful consultation.”   “Treasury has also declined to provide a thorough analysis and the important data that would allow us to properly evaluate the effect of this agreement on the U.S. business community and U.S. revenue.” “[T]he Assistant Secretary’s letter states that Congressional engagement has been ‘valuable in crafting [Treasury’s] negotiating stances and is ultimately reflected in the substance of the current agreement.’ We struggle to see how this is true.” “While Treasury may have accepted an OECD agreement that will put U.S. companies and jobs at risk, there is still time to change course given the significant amount of detail and work that remains to be done.”   “Establishing Congress’s legislative prerogatives is critical to the domestic viability of any OECD tax agreement. . . . We urge you and your chief negotiators to begin fully engaging and consulting with us going forward, starting with in-person briefings and hearings to discuss these important issues.” Finance Committee Republican members have repeatedly requestedengagement, briefings and information regarding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 tax agreement, and have received responses from Treasury that prioritize rhetoric over substance.  Read the full letter, signed by all Senate Finance Committee Republican members, hereor below.  March 31, 2022 The Honorable Janet Yellen SecretaryDepartment of the Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20220Dear Secretary Yellen, Dear Secretary Yellen, While we appreciate the responses to our December 22, 2021, and February 16, 2022, letters, we would like to again bring your attention to the insufficient level of engagement and consultation we have received from this Treasury Department both before and after the Administration entered into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 tax agreement. In response to our December 22, 2021, letter, the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs stated that “Congressional input is a priority for Treasury.” Despite this assertion, we believe Treasury has continuously failed to engage with us in a meaningful manner. In support of his claim, the Assistant Secretary asserts there has been appropriate engagement through briefings provided by Treasury to certain Congressional staff. However, these briefings merely informed certain staff of negotiations after they had occurred, and in most cases, after developments were publicly announced and the corresponding documents were publicly released. After-the-fact briefings with committee and leadership staff do not constitute meaningful consultation. Treasury has also declined to provide a thorough analysis and the important data that would allow us to properly evaluate the effect of this agreement on the U.S. business community and U.S. revenue. This level of engagement does not convey that Treasury views our input as necessary or critical. Further, the Assistant Secretary’s letter states that Congressional engagement has been “valuable in crafting [Treasury’s] negotiating stances and is ultimately reflected in the substance of the current agreement.” We struggle to see how this is true. In a reversal from the prior Administration, the Biden Treasury Department failed to negotiate for current U.S. law to be deemed compliant under Pillar Two, in direct opposition to comments received from us and our staff. Additionally, we, along with many of our Democratic colleagues, have voiced support for the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) provision, yet Treasury has conveyed to OECD countries that FDII will be “abolished.” Similarly, had the Administration actually consulted Congress (rather than merely point to a 2020 “blueprint” after the fact) on whether theagreement’s provision of more favorable treatment to refundable tax credits than to nonrefundable tax credits was an acceptable negotiating outcome, we clearly would have said it was not and advised you to protect U.S. tax incentives to ensure our businesses and workers do not face a competitive disadvantage. Despite the Assistant Secretary’s request for input on the marketing and distribution safe harbor in his recent letter, the Assistant Secretary does not provide any data on the “tradeoffs,” specific options on the table, or any meaningful information to allow us to provide constructive feedback. Such actions do not reflect a Treasury Department that believes Congress should play a meaningful role in these negotiations, or that its views should be taken into account. While Treasury may have accepted an OECD agreement that will put U.S. companies and jobs at risk, there is still time to change course given the significant amount of detail and work that remains to be done. As the recently proposed EU directive acknowledges, the clearly unrealistic timeline is already slipping, and there is ample time for Treasury to begin taking into account what Congress, which has sole tax-writing authority under the U.S. Constitution, is willing and able to enact into law. Establishing Congress’s legislative prerogatives is critical to the domestic viability of any OECD tax agreement. As we have stated many times, implementation of this agreement would require Congressional action, including Senate approval of a multilateral tax treaty. We urge you and your chief negotiators to begin fully engaging and consulting with us going forward, starting with in-person briefings and hearings to discuss these important issues. Sincerely,"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-statement-on-supreme-court-nominee-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) issued the following statement on Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson: “After carefully reviewing Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s judicial record and statements, I will not be supporting her nomination. The role of a Supreme Court justice is to apply the law as written and uphold the Constitution, not legislate from the bench. Both Judge Jackson’s record and testimony during her confirmation hearings indicate that she does not adhere to originalism as her guiding judicial philosophy. “Every nominee to our nation’s highest court deserves a thorough but fair vetting, which was not afforded to President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. Restoring civility to the Supreme Court confirmation process is in our national interest. It can help rebuild trust in both the Court and the Senate itself. “Throughout this process, I have taken my constitutional responsibilities seriously by researching Judge Jackson’s record and reviewing her testimony. I appreciated Judge Jackson taking time to meet with me this week and respond to my questions, but I will be a no vote when her nomination comes to the Senate floor.”"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-discusses-growing-crisis-at-southern-border,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) spoke at a press conference today about the growing crisis at the southern border. “In the 1990s, I had an opportunity to serve on the southern border as a U.S. Marine. At the time, I couldn’t imagine that the border security challenges we experienced then could grow even worse. But that’s what we have today. “The 2020 Census registered the population of Marion County, Indiana at 977,000 Hoosiers. This week, we learned that within the next few days, the U.S. Border Patrol will have had over one million encounters with illegal immigrants just over the last six months. This is indeed a crisis. A number of people greater than the entire population of Indianapolis, Indiana, plus Lawrence, Speedway, Southport, and Beech Grove, attempted to enter the United States in half a year. “What have Washington Democrats done in response to this crisis? They’ve refused to even acknowledge the severity of the problem. Notably, the Biden Administration has presented a budget that shifts money away from border protection. It increases money to help move people through the system, not so we can stop illegal entries, but so that immigration officials can more quickly stamp the hands of those who ultimately get through. The Biden Budget cuts, by 25 percent, the number of beds at ICE detention centers,” said Senator Young. In October, Senator Young pressed the then-nominee for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, Chris Magnus, on whether he considered the situation at the southern border to be a crisis, to which he responded, “Does it really matter?”  Mr. Magnus has since been confirmed to the position. To watch the Senator’s full remarks from the press conference, click here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-rubio-send-letter-to-biden-admin-sounding-the-alarm-on-chinese-firm-didis-access-to-sensitive-data,"WASHINGTON — Yesterday, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler warning of the risk posed by Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing platform with concerning links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Didi Chuxing has expanded its presence in a number of countries around the world, including in key ally nations. The CCP is known to possess de facto control over Chinese companies, requiring the collection of sensitive data for Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services on demand.  “With these deeply concerning facts in mind… we urge the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of State to enact a global prohibition on U.S. military personnel and diplomats from using digital transportation platforms that collect users’ personal information and sensitive geo-location data and are obligated to share that data with Beijing’s intelligence and security services,” the senators wrote. “We also urge the Department of State to update its travel advisories to U.S. citizens traveling to countries in which any such digital transportation platform operates, especially where these platforms may be operating under a different local brand from their parent company.”  “We also urge the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that issuers on U.S. exchanges fully disclose their legal obligation to assist Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services,” the senators continued. “We also urge that any future SEC rulemaking or guidance on environmental, social, and governance reporting requires companies to fully report any such legal obligations to assist Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services, given these entities’ extensive record of human rights abuses and repression both inside and outside of the PRC.”   Senator Young is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and Ranking Member of the Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism. Senator Rubio is Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women’s Issues. The full text of the letter is here and below.  Dear Secretaries Blinken and Austin and Chairman Gensler: We write to express our concern with the risk posed by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) control over a rapidly growing number of technology companies and the sensitive data that these companies collect when operating outside of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The CCP’s ability to exploit this data poses an immediate threat to U.S. national security, the stability and sovereignty of our allies and partners, and the defense of democracy and human rights around the world.  For the past several years, the CCP has worked steadily to build an expansive legal framework that explicitly requires any Chinese company, even nominally privately-owned ones, that collects sensitive data to turn it over to Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services on demand. This explicit legal requirement, repeated throughout the PRC’s national intelligence, national security, counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, and data security laws, means that Chinese technology companies operating abroad pose serious risks to other countries’ national security and sovereignty, as well as their individual citizens’ privacy and safety.  Today, the risk has become even more acute. In its 2021 annual report, the bipartisan, bicameral U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission described how the CCP is contemplating requiring Chinese companies “to hand over management of their data to third-party Chinese information security firms … allow[ing] the information security firms, likely to be backed by China’s government, to monitor Chinese companies’ data.” The Commission also noted that “[t]he Chinese government’s efforts to gain control over data are leading it to assume greater ownership stakes in nonstate firms.” The risk extends far beyond the handful of 5G network, surveillance camera, and social media companies that have received the overwhelming majority of attention to date. Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing platform with concerning links to the CCP, provides the most recent and high-profile example of just how pervasive the risk has become. Didi, which operates its ride-hailing platform in 17 countries beyond China, including key allies and partners such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil, is preparing to soon begin operations in the United Kingdom and across the European Union. Wherever Didi operates, it collects large amounts of highly sensitive data on who is traveling, at which times, and along which routes. The collection of data is concerning as it allows for the identification and surveillance of individuals that the CCP perceives as its enemies – independent journalists, human rights activists, private businesspeople, or anyone promoting a message contradicting the CCP’s carefully-crafted propaganda.  Recent news suggests that the CCP is now making efforts to exercise their legal claim to data collected by Didi. Ministry of State Security intelligence agents are now stationed inside of Didi’s offices with direct access to this data. The company is also reportedly in talks to turn over all its data to a state-controlled third party and to grant Beijing a direct ownership stake with board representation and special governance rights over the data that Didi collects. Didi is further demonstrating its use as a political tool of the CCP by its most recent actions in Russia. On February 21, Didi had announced it would leave the Russian market citing market challenges. After Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Didi changed course, making an announcement on February 26 that the company would remain active in the country. This is clearly a political not an economic decision, undermining claims the company is simply a private business not beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. With these deeply concerning facts in mind, we ask you to address the threat posed to our national security by China’s access to the sensitive data collected by companies like Didi. We urge the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of State to enact a global prohibition on U.S. military personnel and diplomats from using digital transportation platforms that collect users’ personal information and sensitive geo-location data and are obligated to share that data with Beijing’s intelligence and security services. We also urge the Department of State to update its travel advisories to U.S. citizens traveling to countries in which any such digital transportation platform operates, especially where these platforms may be operating under a different local brand from their parent company. We also urge the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that issuers on U.S. exchanges fully disclose their legal obligation to assist Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services. We also urge that any future SEC rulemaking or guidance on environmental, social, and governance reporting requires companies to fully report any such legal obligations to assist Beijing’s intelligence agencies and security services, given these entities’ extensive record of human rights abuses and repression both inside and outside of the PRC.   We thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-shaheen-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-address-shortage-of-mental-health-providers-in-schools,"WASHINGTON – Last week, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) introduced the Mental Health Excellence in Schools Act to address the shortage of mental health providers in schools by authorizing the Department of Education to partner with higher education institutions to help cover students’ costs at relevant graduate programs. The bipartisan legislation would boost the pipeline of graduate students trained to become school psychologists, counselors, and social workers responding to the youth mental health crisis that has been worsened by the pandemic.  “Access to critical mental health resources in schools is important for the safety, well-being, and academic performance of Hoosier students,” said Senator Young. “The Mental Health Excellence in Schools Act will help address the severe shortage of mental health professionals by partnering with graduate schools to increase education and participation in the school-based mental health workforce.” “The pandemic put a spotlight on just how many students across New Hampshire and the nation struggle with isolation, depression and mental health challenges. We need mental health professionals in schools equipped to counsel students and help them heal from trauma. Unfortunately, we don’t have a strong pipeline of mental health providers, leaving many kids and teenagers vulnerable and without the help they need,” said Senator Shaheen. “That’s why I’m introducing new bipartisan legislation to invest in the next generation of mental health professionals serving in schools. By helping more students afford graduate programs centered on school-based mental health, we can attract more workers to this critical field. The mental health crisis isn’t going away, and it’s past time we dedicate resources and energy towards holistically helping those in need. We owe it to our children to empower them with tools to heal and succeed.”  “Our students need more support than ever, but without enough school psychologists and other school-based mental health providers our schools aren’t equipped to meet their growing needs. We are thrilled to see the bipartisan Senate introduction of the Mental Health in Schools Excellence Program Act and thank Senator Shaheen, Young, Peters, and Cramer for their leadership on this critical issue,” said Dr. Kathleen Minke, Executive Director of the National Association of School Psychologists. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) recommends a ratio of one school psychologist per 500 students. However, the national average ratio is estimated to be approximately one school psychologist per 1,211 students, with wide variation among states. The Mental Health Excellence in Schools Act seeks to increase the recruitment and retention of mental health services providers in schools. The legislation creates a program for the U.S. Department of Education to partner with eligible graduate institutions to cover up to the full cost of school-based mental health graduate programs for students at eligible institutions. Similar companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House by Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.). Full text of the bill is available here.###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-urge-administration-to-help-unite-ukrainian-children-with-american-adoptive-families,"WASHINGTON – This week, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on a bipartisan letter to the Biden Administration urging immediate action to unite Ukrainian children going through the adoption process with American adoptive or host families. The lawmakers specifically called on the Biden Administration to identify the approximately 300 Ukrainian children waiting to join American adoptive or host families and work with the Ukrainian government to find a way forward to allow children with in-process adoptions to travel to stay with host families in the United States instead of requiring these children to remain in other locations for displaced persons in Europe or in Ukraine. “We write to advocate for immediately uniting American host families with Ukrainian children who are engaged in the adoption process, based on the shared belief that every child deserves a safe, stable, and loving place to call home,” the senators wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“Regardless of where children are within the adoption process, protecting vulnerable children should remain a top priority for Ukraine and the United States.” “American families seeking to adopt or be host families for a Ukrainian child are eager to welcome these children into their home and provide the affection, stability, and safety all children deserve,”the senators continued. “As you continue to lead the United States’ diplomatic response to the invasion of Ukraine, we request that you raise our concerns regarding these children in institutionalized care to the highest levels of our diplomatic engagement, so that they are prioritized in protection and response measures.” In addition to Senators Young, Blunt, and Klobuchar, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators John Thune (R-S.D.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Angus King (I-Maine), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The full letter is available here."

It means expediting permits [to] bring more capacity online. It means encouraging new, private sector investments.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-expand-child-care-options-for-families,"WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) introduced the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Reauthorization Act of 2022, legislation to build on Congress’ 30-year record of bipartisan work to support and enhance child care programs across the nation. This legislation, which serves as an alternative approach to the overbearing child care proposals Democrats pushed in their reckless tax and spending bill, would improve affordability of child care programs and allow parents to choose the provider that best fits their family’s needs. The CCDBG Reauthorization Act also includes key elements of Senator Young’s Early Educators Apprenticeship Act which addresses child care workforce pipeline issues by supporting apprenticeships. “Hoosier families are counting on us to correct the Democrats’ proposed government takeover of child care and preschool that parents don’t want and can’t afford. We introduced this bill to allow parents maximum choice in child care and preschool providers to best suit their families. I’m also encouraged that this bill will create stronger support for child care teachers to attain post-secondary degrees and credentials, a major feature of myEarly Educators Apprenticeship Act,” said Senator Young. “The Democrats’ child care proposals would take a wrecking ball to our child care system and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach that limits families’ options,” said Senator Scott. “I believe there is a better way. This bill improves upon a program that has already helped families afford a variety of options to care for the most important people in their lives: their kids.” “Working parents need affordable, reliable, and safe child care that best fits their family’s needs,” said Senator Burr. “Throughout the pandemic, as public schools closed, child care providers across the nation remained open, thanks in large part to the architecture and flexibility of the CCDBG program. As many states now face a shortage of affordable child care, the last thing Congress should do is force through unpopular, partisan proposals that many states will reject and that will leave millions of children uncovered. Instead, we should build on existing, bipartisan, and successful programs, like CCDBG. I’m proud to work with Senator Scott on this important legislation.” Cosponsoring the bill along with Senators Young, Scott, and Burr, were Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska).  Background: Rather than create two new child care and preschool entitlement programs, as the Democrats proposed in their reckless tax and spending bill, the CCDBG Reauthorization Act of 2022 makes responsible enhancements to the historically bipartisan CCDBG program, which has assisted working families with their child care and preschool needs for the last 30 years. Specifically, the reauthorization: Read full text of the bill here. "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-finance-committee-republicans-to-ask-yellen-for-update-on-social-security-and-medicare-trustees-reports,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy, and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, along with all other Finance Committee Republicans, sent a letter requesting U.S. Department of Treasury Secretary Yellen provide an update on the status of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds reports, which by law are to be issued annually by April 1. The reports have rarely been distributed on time in recent years, with the 2021 report not delivered until August 31. While the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has made recommendations to Treasury on process improvements in recent years, the recommendations have not been fully incorporated into the process for developing the trust fund reports. As Managing Trustee of the trust funds, it is the responsibility of the Treasury Secretary to provide these reports to Congress in a timely manner, as required by law, or provide Congress and the American people with explanations for late work. From the letter: “The 2021 trustees report was released 152 days late, with little-to-no information provided to the public and to Congress explaining the reasons for, and the expected duration of, the delay.”… “Before Congress debates any further legislation that impacts either the Medicare or Social Security programs, it is imperative that policymakers have accurate and timely information regarding the financial operations of these critical safety-net programs.”… “For Congress and the public to provide effective oversight of the Social Security and Medicare programs and trust funds, your role as Managing Trustee of the boards of trustees for Social Security and Medicare requires that you provide timely information as required by the law,” the senators wrote. Read the full letter here or below.  March 21, 2022 The Honorable Janet YellenManaging Trustee; Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds Department of the Treasury1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, DC 20220 Dear Secretary Yellen, The Social Security Act requires that reports analyzing the current and projected financial status of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be issued annually, and no later than April 1 of each calendar year. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the trustees have consistently failed to release these mandated reports to Congress on time. In 2019, GAO stated that the trustees had missed their statutory deadline in 17 of the preceding 25 years. The 2021 trustees report was released 152 days late, with little-to-no information provided to the public and to Congress explaining the reasons for, and the expected duration of, the delay. Regrettably, 2008 was the last year in which the statutory reporting deadline had been satisfied. Congress continues to make key decisions regarding fiscal spending and long term outlays through the current budgetary window (2022-2031). Either through reconciliation or regular order, there is every expectation that Congress will consider additional health care related legislation this year. Before Congress debates any further legislation that impacts either the Medicare or Social Security programs, it is imperative that policymakers have accurate and timely information regarding the financial operations of these critical safety-net programs. Exacerbating this problem further, since 2016, there have been no public trustees confirmed to serve as public voices in communicating the state of the trust funds to the American public. Denying participation of public trustees in the report development process effectively denies the American people a voice when it comes to Social Security and Medicare. Seeking to amend this broken reporting process, Republicans in Congress asked GAO to review the trustees report development process and provide recommendations to improve or modify it. In 2019, GAO submitted two suggestions for executive action to address the late issuance of reports:  A subsequent September 30, 2021 GAO report noted that Treasury had taken relatively minor steps to improve report management, but that overall the suggested recommendations have not been fully implemented. On the first recommendation, GAO observed, “Other than tracking the planned and actual dates of each reporting cycle, Treasury has not told [GAO] about any other steps it took to manage the report development schedule…” On the second recommendation, GAO noted that agency officials representing the trustees and overseeing the development of the reports indicated that a policy had been established to notify Congress if the trustees anticipated issuing the reports after the April 1 statutory deadline. According to GAO, that new policy states that “the chairperson of the working group will ‘assess the need to notify Congress of the reports’ timing.’” GAO continued, “The policy does not specify how the trustees would make that assessment, nor does it mention including the reasons for the delay in this communication to Congress.” A Treasury official acknowledged that they did not interpret GAO’s recommendation to mean that the policy itself had to address communicating the reasons for the delayed report. Consequently, GAO deemed the Treasury response inadequate, saying, “This policy does not fully address our recommendation because it implies that notifying Congress should be discretionary and does not call for any explanation for the delays and updated time frames. The policy should serve as a prompt for subsequent working groups to provide timely updates and address all of the information we recommended communicating to Congress.” Although GAO observed that agency officials had informed congressional staff via an email in March 2021 that Treasury anticipated missing the statutory reporting deadline by “at least eight weeks,” GAO also noted that Treasury officials failed to follow-up with congressional staff until the reports were publicly issued on August 31, 2021. GAO further reported that Treasury stated its intention to have provided an additional update in May, but that this communication had not occurred “due to an internal miscommunication.” While the COVID-19 pandemic affected every part of society in 2020 and 2021, the delayed issuance of the trustees reports in those years remained consistent with the long-term trend of administrations evading, or at the very least, failing to uphold, their statutorily-defined duties. The specific lack of responsiveness exhibited by Treasury staff last year, which Senator Crapo detailed in his previous letter to you of August 5, 2021, indicates that proactive outreach by Congress continues to be met with no substantive actions to improve matters.  Furthermore, the leadership void at the Social Security Administration created by the politicized firing of Commissioner Saul and Deputy Commissioner Black, and the continuing vacancies of the public trustee positions for both Social Security and Medicare, cannot excuse the remaining members of the boards for their noncompliance. This Administration has made itself and one political party solely responsible for the management of Social Security and Medicare, and it now bears the duty to provide a comprehensive update on its management to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. We therefore urge you, as Managing Trustee, to fully incorporate GAO’s 2019 recommendations, including these examples of actions GAO listed in their 2021 report:  Our understanding is that Treasury received an advanced draft of GAO’s 2021 report, and that Treasury is committed to improving the reports’ timeliness, as well as “…to communicating with Congress on these issues, [including to] track and log working group notifications to Congress on report timing going forward to promote the delivery of prompt updates.” For Congress and the public to provide effective oversight of the Social Security and Medicare programs and trust funds, your role as Managing Trustee of the boards of trustees for Social Security and Medicare requires by law that you provide timely information. As we now approach the April 1 deadline, we request that you provide:  Neither we nor our staffs have received any communications regarding the development of the 2022 trustees reports, causing concern about their status. We respectfully request that you, as Managing Trustee, commit to developing better policies, more in line with GAO’s recommendations, to keep the congressional committees of jurisdiction and the public regularly informed of the anticipated report delivery dates when trustees anticipate missing the statutory deadline of April 1. Doing so will ensure that the management of these important programs will remain accountable to the American people under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Sincerely, ###"

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-joins-commerce-secretary-bipartisan-national-security-experts-for-discussion-on-domestic-semiconductor-manufacturing-usica,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Department of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a bipartisan panel discussion about the national security imperative of incentivizing domestic semiconductor manufacturing and moving forward with his United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) as it approaches a formal conference committee in the coming weeks. Senator Young and Secretary Raimondo were joined by Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) and former national security officials and experts, including retired General H.R. McMaster, Former National Security Advisor; Matt Pottinger, Former Deputy National Security Advisor; Bonnie Glick, Former Deputy Administrator of the USAID; Keith Krach, Former Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth; and Eric Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Futures and former CEO and Chairman of Google. “Throughout our nation's recent history, Republicans and Democrats have consistently worked together on critical national security issues like this one, issues that are bigger than whatever our domestic political divisions may be at a given moment. This is the very type of issue we're talking about today. We have a national security imperative to ensure that we don't fall behind China in our technological innovation. This innovation is historically a key driver of our nation's economic growth, and our ability to defend our values. American leadership in science and technology, especially the emerging technologies that will dominate the 21st century, is vital to both the future of the American economy and to our competitiveness with China, in particular, the Endless Frontier Act and the Chips Act portions of the legislation that we're considering, will help us lay the foundation for the private sector to harness the innovation occurring around the country and will contribute toward the construction of fabs that will create the resilience necessary to better compete globally, both economically and militarily. “I'm excited that we're moving forward with the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act in the Senate this week so we can be in a position to start a formal conference negotiation with the House before the end of the work period. Now it is, as you say, Secretary Raimondo, it's very important for this to be a bipartisan effort.“I'm glad the process moved forward, but I do think that the process should be open with input from all of my colleagues and consistent with what we call around here regular order. In the Senate, that resulted in 68 votes, bipartisan votes. And I think the American people have an opportunity to weigh in a little more robustly and get more buy-in. A bipartisan bill and a bipartisan showing also communicates a very important message to the Chinese Communist Party. It says that that the people's representatives in Congress and in the Senate are taking their generational, perhaps multigenerational, challenge very seriously, were united on this effort. And we're determined to do whatever it takes to defend our values and our way of life.  “I know the vote will not be unanimous and that both parties and members of both parties are going to have to make principled compromises, principled concessions, in order to get an agreement done. That's always what happens when you approach a negotiating table. But America and the world will be better off with a bipartisan, broadly supported final product. “I'm incredibly encouraged to see this panel of leaders here today from bipartisan administrations, representing different parts of the country, and different capacities. And I think that's consistent with what we're going to see in coming weeks and months,” said Senator Young. To watch the full panel, click here."

It will conduct a thorough review of advances in emerging biotechnology, provide an interim report to the President of the United States and the Armed Services Committees within one year, and submit a final unclassified report within two years to the President and the committees, including recommendations for action by Congress and the federal government.“I am excited to be named to the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, and I look forward to examining the serious questions about the role biotechnology plays in our rapidly changing world,” said Senator Young. “As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring the national security implications of biotechnology has never been more important. From weapons to farming to manufacturing, the opportunities and applications for this technology are vast. Both the promises and perils of this emerging field demands thoughtful scrutiny while working to ensure American leadership on the questions surrounding standard setting of this technology.” Senator Young is the lead Republican co-sponsor of the United States Innovation and Competition Act, also known as the Endless Frontier Act, which would invest in emerging technologies like biotech, and establish tech hubs around the country to ensure high-tech jobs are not concentrated on the coasts.Joining Senator Young on the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology are:U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Cal.)U.S. Representative Stephanie Bice (R-OK-05)U.S. Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA-17)The Honorable Dov S.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-wicker-applaud-fmcsa-advancement-of-18-to-21-year-old-truck-driver-pilot-program,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) applauded the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for advancing the 18 to 21-year-old truck driver pilot program.  This program will allow 18 to 21-year-old truck drivers to operate in interstate commerce, as they currently do in intrastate commerce. The pilot program includes a number of safety requirements, such as advanced technology in trucks, an accompanying experienced driver, and the participation of motor carriers with a safe record. “Today, 18-year-olds can drive more than 200 miles from New Albany to Gary and back, but they aren’t allowed to drive two miles from New Albany to Louisville,” said Senator Young. “My DRIVE-Safe pilot program will address the driver shortage, provide new career opportunities for young Hoosiers and Americans, and make the roads safer. We have faced a truck driver shortage for years, but it has now reached a crisis level as we witness major supply chain bottlenecks across all sectors. I commend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for acting swiftly to establish this program.”  “If a 19-year-old can safely drive a truck from one end of our state to the other, federal law should allow the same young American to drive across state lines,” said Senator Wicker. “Implementation of this important provision will help address driver workforce challenges, which are particularly important given the ongoing supply chain transportation disruptions. Though I have concerns about the Registered Apprenticeship program requirement, I appreciate FMCSA’s work to advance this important program.” The 18 to 21-year-old truck driver pilot program was based on Senator Young’s DRIVE-Safe Act, which was introduced in February 2019. The pilot program was included in the Senate Commerce Committee’s Surface Transportation Investment Act that was part of the bipartisan infrastructure law. "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-scott-thune-introduce-bill-to-combat-inflationary-spending,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced the Inflation Prevention Act (IPA) that would help combat inflationary spending. Due to record government spending over the last two years, many Americans are facing rapidly rising costs of consumer goods. This bill would bar legislation that would be estimated to increase inflation until the year-over-year inflation rate drops below 4.5 percent. “Under the Biden inflation crisis, inflation is at a 40-year high and working Americans are struggling to pay for the daily essentials. For months, Democrats have ignored the problem, blaming everything instead of their socialist spending agenda. The Inflation Prevention Act would ensure that the bills we are voting on in Congress do not make this problem worse,” said Senator Young. Joining Senators Young, Scott, and Thune are Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.).  “American families cannot continue to endure the burden of skyrocketing costs of everyday goods brought on by reckless spending in Washington,” said Senator Tim Scott. “A sound financial future requires wise financial action now.”  “Our country is facing the highest level of inflation in nearly 40 years, and South Dakotans are paying more for food, utilities, and gas,” said Senator Thune. “I’m proud to join Sen. Scott in the fight to stop the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending spree, which would significantly worsen the already damaging inflation crisis.” This bill has also garnered support from several organizations including the National Taxpayers Union, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform, FreedomWorks, and the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC).    Full text of the legislation can be found here.  ###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-slams-democrats-plans-to-break-the-senate,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) delivered a speech on the Senate floor condemning the Democrats’ plans to change the Senate rules in order to seize control of America’s elections. “If you want to end gridlock, do the difficult work of actually building coalitions of support, introduce bills to be referred to the committees of jurisdiction that Republicans can actually vote for, allow for an open amendment process, as we did with the China bill.  “Now this is the entire point of the 60-vote threshold. It’s a forcing mechanism, during fraught times like these. It gives the minority a say in the process. It forces majorities to find ways to compromise. It incentivizes bipartisan collaboration among senators representing diverse parts of our nation with differing values, differing priorities. Americans want us to go through the hard work of finding common ground. ... “I said it in my first speech on this floor … and I will repeat it until my last speech: We are, above all else, the custodians of the common good. The common good. Remember that colleagues before you take a hammer to one of the Senate’s signature means of advancing it,” said Senator Young during his speech. To view the Senator Young’s full speech, click here.  Senator Young’s Floor Remarks as Prepared for Delivery: In a letter written in 1789, Thomas Jefferson declared the “earth belongs to the living, not the dead.” Relationships between generations, he explained, are but that of distant, independent nations. Mr. President, I don’t know how many of my Democratic colleagues still admire Jefferson, but they are certainly taking his words to heart. There is little concern on one side of this chamber about the impact of our actions beyond our own time here. There is a belief that the importance of this hour’s partisan ambitions outweighs the value of centuries’ old institutions. Abandoning the 60-vote threshold in order to seize control of America’s elections isn’t simply short-sighted. It’s clueless, it’s the exact opposite of what the people who sent us here want. Back home in Indiana, I hear from anxious Hoosiers about rising inflation, about the cost of putting food on their tables and gas in their cars. About paying to heat their homes or for next month’s rent. They are tired of and still worried about a pandemic President Biden promised to “shut down.” And they are angry about a southern border he has left wide open. In the middle of all this, an affordability crisis, an ongoing pandemic, a broken border, changing the Senate’s rules to nationalize Indiana’s elections, repeal our popular voter ID law and use tax dollars to fund political campaigns are not high among Hoosier priorities.  You know what is though? Congress coming together, finding compromise and actually addressing our shared national challenges. It’s one of the most widely-ignored messages of the last election. If Americans wanted radical, extreme, partisan change, they would not have evenly divided the Senate. Believe it or not, they want us to collaborate. We have shown them we are capable of doing that. We formed a united front against China when it comes to competitiveness and trade policy.We helped American workers and small businesses hurt by the pandemic. We gave our troops a raise. These are important achievements that will benefit Americans now and in the years to come. I understand that my Democratic colleagues are frustrated though. You have had less success with your reckless multi-trillion dollar social spending bill. And your proposal to federalize and politicize America’s elections is a tough sell. As a result, America’s democracy, we are told, is in peril. And the only way to save it is to kill the filibuster. But the 60-vote threshold is not the source of the dysfunction; your radical agenda is. The legislative filibuster is not a threat to our democracy; ending it is. My advice: rethink your priorities. If you want to end gridlock, do the difficult work of building coalitions, introduce bills Republicans can vote for, allow for an open amendment process. That is the entire point of the 60-vote threshold.  It gives the minority a say in the process. It forces majorities to find ways to compromise. It incentivizes bipartisan collaboration among senators representing parts of the nation with differing values and priorities, which is what Americans want.  And yes, it is an obstacle to one party, either party, razing our institutions by the slimmest of margins. Frustrating as it may be, the filibuster, in its way, is a source of, and sometimes the source of, order and even unity in Congress. If you think our current political division is troubling, torch the filibuster, foist your unpopular partisan priorities on the American people and then check the health of our democracy. Don’t be shocked by its sorry state.  I’ll close with a familiar caveat. Majorities, no matter their size, never endure. Looked at in the light of human history, all of us, even the most long-tenured, are here for little more than a hiccup in time.  Yes, what one party sows today, the other will reap tomorrow. Clearing the path for every grandly ambitious Democratic piece of legislation aimed at reshaping America would only clear the way for a future Republican effort to repeal and replace it with one of our own. With even greater scale. Beyond this though, as much as I admire Thomas Jefferson, I do not believe that the earth belongs only to the living. No, citizens place both their trust and their destiny in a set of shared institutions. In America, this forms a compact that stretches across centuries and generations. It includes those in the grave and those yet unborn. And for the moment, we are its custodians.  If we give in to temporary passions, if we tear our institutions to shreds rather than work through them, rewriting the rules when we don’t win the game, we are failing in our jobs. We are breaking that compact.   I said it in my first speech on this floor. I will repeat until my last: We are, above all else, the custodians of the common good. Remember that before you take a hammer to one of the Senate’s signature means of advancing it."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-youngs-office-helps-record-number-of-hoosiers-in-2021,"WASHINGTON – Once again, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and his staff set records for the number of constituents represented in cases before federal agencies this year. In 2021, Senator Young’s office resolved more than 2,500 constituent issues and returned more than $46 million owed to Hoosiers by various government agencies. Since assuming office in 2017, Senator Young has helped more than 7,600 Hoosiers recover nearly $58 million from federal agencies. In 2020, the office resolved 2,014 cases and returned more than $4.1 million to Hoosiers.  For the second consecutive year, there was a surge in inquiries related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related payments and delays. The office helped 323 taxpayers receive delayed tax refunds or missing stimulus payments. Due to the closure of passport offices, Senator Young fielded more than eight times the usual number of passport requests. “This year, much of our constituent service work centered around pandemic-related delays, and some of these problems came as the result of the Biden Administration’s failure to provide quality customer service while Americans went back to work,” said Senator Young.“Government should be at its best during emergencies, not causing additional headaches for taxpayers.” In April, Senator Young questioned IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig about delays in refund processing. Earlier this month, Senator Young pushed the Social Security Administration to re-open field offices around the country. Additionally, Senator Young’s office helped approximately 60 people exit Afghanistan after the Biden Administration’s disastrous evacuation that left American citizens and Afghan nationals who supported the U.S. military stranded in the country while the Taliban retook control of the country.   Hoosiers who think they may need help with a federal agency can visit young.senate.gov and click “Help for Hoosiers”."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-amicus-brief-opposing-vaccine-mandate-for-private-employers_,"WASHINGTON – Senator Todd Young was among the 47 Senators and 136 Representatives who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States in today’s case considering the Biden Administration’s vaccine mandate on private employers. The top-down Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) requires private employers with over 100 employees to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing. The brief argues that Congress did not give OSHA the authority to impose a vaccine mandate and urges SCOTUS to stay the mandate. In the brief, the Members write: “Congressional members have an interest in the powers they delegate to agencies not being abused—the legislative authority vested in the federal government belongs to Congress, not the Executive branch. In this case, the promulgation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) of a sweeping, nationwide vaccine mandate on businesses intrudes into an area of legislative concern far beyond the authority of the agency. And it does so with a Mandate enacted through OSHA’s seldom-used ‘emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) provision that allows for bypass of notice and comment rulemaking under certain circumstances. That OSHA exceeded its authority in enacting the ETS Mandate is not a ‘particularly hard’ question.” The members continue: “Moreover, congressional members—as representatives of the people of their States and districts—have an interest in the citizens they represent being able to craft local solutions to problems facing their States and districts. Federalism concerns should be addressed before requiring federally-imposed solutions. And this is especially true when the question at issue involves an area typically reserved to the States (such as vaccine mandates). At the least, Congress should be forced to make clear any delegations of authority into areas of State control.” Read the full text of the brief here. The brief was signed by:Sens.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-finance-republicans-to-demand-treasury-analysis-of-oecd-agreement,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined Senate Finance Committee Republicans in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to renew requests for information regarding international tax negotiations. To date, Treasury has been unwilling or unable to fully engage with Congress to provide details on the negotiations, which will have a significant impact on American workers, businesses and revenue. The senators raise concerns with how the negotiations may negatively impact U.S. competitiveness; the commitment from the United States to increase its global minimum tax before any other country; and suggestions that Treasury could implement the agreement without the advice and consent of the Senate, bypassing the treaty process. From the letter: “The Administration’s rush to reach a political agreement, tied to its domestic spending plans and pursuit of revenue, has come at the expense of thorough analysis and meaningful engagement with Congress and the business community, and may ultimately put U.S. businesses at risk... Given this agreement’s potential to jeopardize U.S. competitiveness, we continue to have concerns with the lack of detail underlying the approach being proposed under Pillar One and its lack of foundation in any discernible tax principles.  … Further troubling is Treasury’s continued insistence that the United States once again move first by significantly increasing the U.S. global minimum tax... As Pillar Two does not require other countries to adopt a global minimum tax, we are not confident that our biggest foreign competitors, like China, will enact and implement a global minimum tax on the same terms or on the timeline agreed to at the OECD.… Finally, suggestions that the United States could fully implement Pillar One without the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate through the treaty process are highly problematic... [A]ny suggestion that Pillar One can be implemented absent treaty ratification is a dramatic shift from past precedent and calls into question the binding nature of any such agreement, thereby threatening the very tax certainty that many of our companies, and this Administration, claim to seek under Pillar One.” The senators end the letter with a detailed list of questions regarding the proposals, reiterating that any opportunity for a bipartisan outcome will require greater transparency and engagement from Treasury.  In addition to Senator Young, the following Republican members of the Finance Committee signed the letter:  Full text of the letter can be read here or below. December 22, 2021 The Honorable Janet Yellen SecretaryDepartment of the Treasury1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20220 Dear Secretary Yellen, We remain focused on ensuring the agreement reached at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 regarding international taxation allows U.S. businesses and workers to remain globally competitive.  Because this Administration has failed to provide us with the detail necessary to evaluate the agreement, we renew our request for this information. U.S. engagement in the OECD negotiations has historically received broad, bipartisan support given the key objective of eliminating discriminatory digital services taxes (DSTs).  Rather than prioritizing this shared goal, this Administration’s focus shifted to its domestic agenda of increasing taxes on American businesses, including through a higher global minimum tax.  The Administration’s rush to reach a political agreement, tied to its domestic spending plans and pursuit of revenue, has come at the expense of thorough analysis and meaningful engagement with Congress and the business community, and may ultimately put U.S. businesses at risk. Given this agreement’s potential to jeopardize U.S. competitiveness, we continue to have concerns with the lack of detail underlying the approach being proposed under Pillar One and its lack of foundation in any discernible tax principles.  Although you have stated that Pillar One will be “largely revenue neutral” to the United States, you have refused to provide us with an analysis substantiating your claim.  You have also undercut this assertion by acknowledging that open design features may “materially impact American companies and the fiscal position of the United States relative to other countries.” We are also concerned the Pillar One implementation timeline agreed to by this Administration is not realistic.  The Administration’s recent agreements allow existing DSTs to remain in place, pause all U.S. retaliatory options, and require implementation by December 31, 2023 in order for DSTs to be removed.  Given the number of open issues remaining and the need for all countries to achieve consensus, implementation by 2023 is likely unachievable.  These agreements appear to eliminate any U.S. leverage, while attempting to manipulate Congress to act—potentially to the detriment of U.S. businesses and revenue—in order for DST relief to be achieved. Further troubling is Treasury’s continued insistence that the United States once again move first by significantly increasing the U.S. global minimum tax.  The United States already acted first when the global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) minimum tax was enacted – four years ago.  Yet the United States remains the only country that imposes a global minimum tax on its companies.  As Pillar Two does not require other countries to adopt a global minimum tax, we are not confident that our biggest foreign competitors, like China, will enact and implement a global minimum tax on the same terms or on the timeline agreed to at the OECD. Finally, suggestions that the United States could fully implement Pillar One without the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate through the treaty process are highly problematic.  Beyond constitutional concerns, any suggestion of implementation through a congressional-executive agreement at this stage is entirely inappropriate: this Administration chose not to engage with Congress to establish a legislative procedure defining OECD negotiating objectives or providing a detailed oversight and consultation process.  The Administration cannot now assert it has the authority to enter into such an agreement.  Overall, any suggestion that Pillar One can be implemented absent treaty ratification is a dramatic shift from past precedent and calls into question the binding nature of any such agreement, thereby threatening the very tax certainty that many of our companies, and this Administration, claim to seek under Pillar One. Any opportunity for a bipartisan outcome will require greater transparency and engagement.  We ask that you provide prompt answers to the following questions surrounding these proposals:  a.    The amount of profit that would be reallocated between the United States and foreign countries, including a breakdown of estimated amounts by country.b.    The net revenue impact of Pillar One to the United States.  a.    Treasury’s proposed approach for implementation, including the expected treaty actions, domestic legislation, and changes to our competent authority agreements.b.    Treasury’s proposed timeline for the United States to implement Pillar One.c.    If it is Treasury’s position that treaty action will not be necessary to implement Pillar One, by what means and under what authority will the U.S. enter into a multilateral convention? Please provide a detailed analysis regarding how each of the United States’ bilateral tax treaties’ permanent establishment provisions will be modified through means other than the formal treaty approval process.d.    If Pillar One is not implemented by December 31, 2023, will U.S. companies have any recourse for DSTs collected between now and that date? Will other countries be free to enact DSTs at that time?  e.    What are the OECD’s plans for public consultation with stakeholders, including Congress and the U.S. business community, before design and implementation plans are finalized?  What efforts are the Treasury Department taking to ensure meaningful public consultation takes place?   We will continue to engage in good faith to evaluate the effects of this agreement on American workers, businesses, and revenue.  However, this Administration’s current posture of stonewalling our requests for relevant, material information has made it impossible to make this determination. We appreciate your attention to these issues and look forward to your timely response to our questions. Sincerely,"

The combination of these factors has led to an incredibly strenuous environment for our constituents, one that they cannot withstand much longer. We must identify measures to increase productivity, unkink the chain, and finds ways to be efficient before even more businesses go under.  We appreciate the efforts undertaken to address supply chain challenges such as the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force (Task Force). Unfortunately, the Task Force has failed to deliver meaningful and immediate relief. While the installation of the Port Envoy could achieve beneficial changes, the initiative is too narrow and fails to address the entirety of port congestion, not just the concentration evident at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Further, warehouse space and chassis availability continue to represent a significant hurdle in in alleviating congestion. The recent announcement to open the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports for 24/7 operation addresses working hours, but not the fundamental issue of available chassis and escalating costs passed down to consumers and incurred by importers struggling to manage inventory and secure inputs.  Our constituents are simply asking for action that leads to results, which so far has not occurred in a meaningful way. In that vein, we are requesting written responses to a series of questions below regarding tangible action and improvements to port congestion and supply chain disruptions.   We look forward to your thorough answers to these questions, which we will share with our constituents in need.  Sincerely,"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-discusses-rising-cost-of-child-care-under-democrats-build-back-better-plan,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a press conference with his Senate GOP colleagues to discuss provisions in Democrats’ Build Back Better plan that would reduce child care options for parents, raise child care costs, and hinder child care providers’ ability to operate and retain workers. “In the great state of Indiana … child care costs actually exceed the cost of higher education. This issue has not received enough attention. “The worst thing we could do is to put out of business our existing child care providers, which is precisely what the Build Back Better plan would do,” said Senator Young during the press conference. According to a left-leaning think tank, the Build Back Better plan would increase child care costs by $13,000 per year per child. By increasing demand for child care without addressing the already limited supply of providers, Build Back Better will make it more difficult for parents to find and afford child care. Additionally, faith-based providers would have to meet extra requirements, likely putting some out of business.  To hear the Senator’s full remarks, click here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-votes-to-pass-final-defense-authorization-to-prioritize-troops-strengthen-national-security,"WASHINGTON – Today, after months of unnecessary delays, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) voted to approve the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill passed by a vote of 89-10 and included provisions that will benefit our military and make Americans safer and more secure.   “While Democrats haggled over their reckless tax-and-spend proposal, this vital defense bill has been on the back burner receiving little attention. Though it’s later than it should have been, the version we passed today is far better than President Biden’s original plan. It gives our troops a pay raise and puts real resources behind countering the aggressive actions of Putin’s Russia and the Chinese Communist Party.   “I’m proud to have secured several key provisions in this bill, including provisions to strengthen cybersecurity cooperation with Israel, invest in emerging technologies, and create a bipartisan commission to examine our two decades of war in Afghanistan. The bill also includes a plan I worked on with members of the Burmese community in Indiana to support the restoration of democracy in Burma,” said Senator Young. As passed, this NDAA gives our troops a 2.7 percent pay raise and provides a 3 percent increase over the previous year’s military budget. This increase is more for our military than President Biden’s proposal, which would have slashed defense spending. This increase is critical to keep pace with the Chinese Communist Party which has averaged ranged between 7.2 percent and 8.1 percent increases in year-over-year growth since 2016. Senator Young, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and Marine who serves on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worked to ensure the bill would strengthen our military, while keeping Americans safe amidst threats from coronavirus, Russia, and the Chinese Communist Party.  The NDAA was also a success for keeping liberal priorities out of the final bill. The compromise legislation rejected distractions that would have impacted the rights of Hoosier gun owners and would have required women to register for the draft.  Four of Senator Young’s national security priorities were included in the legislation. Senator Young’s provisions in the NDAA: The Afghanistan War Commission Act to establish a 16-member nonpartisan commission to examine military, diplomatic and intelligence activities by the U.S. from late 1996 to the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan in August. This is essential as we examine our two decades at war and our failed withdrawal from Afghanistan. U.S.-Israel Cybersecurity Cooperation Enhancement to establish a Department of Homeland Security grant program to facilitate closer U.S.-Israel cybersecurity cooperation. Pilot program on acquisition practices for emerging technologies to bring the themes of Senator Young’s Endless Frontier Act into the Department of Defense. This requires the Department to identify and award no less than four agreements for new projects to support high priority modernization activities that are consistent with the National Defense Strategy and creates an advisory group to bring private sector expertise into the process. Support Democracy in Burma, a bipartisan amendment that was drafted with the input of leaders from across the Burmese community in an effort to restore democracy and hold those responsible accountable following this year’s coup. This amendment requires the U.S. government to examine supporting the National Unity Government, denying legitimacy for the junta, and the role sanctions could play in accountability. Senator Young also secured the following provisions in support of Indiana projects: Anti-Submarine Warfare Equipment:As the United States engages in strategic competition, our Navy will be at the forefront of securing vital sea lanes, protecting commerce, and reducing threats to the homeland from the navies of China and Russia. Sonobuoys, like those manufactured by Ultra Electronics in Columbia City, Indiana, are a vital tool in detecting and tracking submarine threats from our peer competitors. Senator Young secured a 20% increase in funding to procure additional sonobuoys. Persistent Maritime Intelligence Gathering:Senator Young also secured funding support for two additional MQ-4C Triton drones, reversing the Biden Administration’s decision to not procure this aircraft. The Triton provides long-range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities over vast oceans spaces. As the United States seeks to deter against China in the Pacific, this airborne capability will be invaluable in monitoring China’s deployments of ships and aircraft. Rolls-Royce produces the engines for the Triton in Indianapolis, Indianapolis.  Vital Ground Combat Capabilities:With Vladimir Putin and Russia threatening the security of Europe and the NATO alliance, now is not the time to reduce the acquisition of the necessary armor capabilities to deter against Russian aggression. Senator Young secured important increases in the procurement and development of the newest version of the venerable Abrams tank, the transmission for which is produced by Allison Transmission in Indianapolis, Indiana. This funding will ensure that the U.S. Army is fully equipped to win on the battlefields of today and tomorrow."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-highlights-democrats-efforts-to-supersize-the-irs,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a press conference with his Senate GOP colleagues to discuss a provision in Democrats’ Build Back Better plan that would supersize the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). “The American people deserve to know: The Democrats propose spending eighty billion in their tax, borrow, spend, and regulate Build Back Better Plan. Eighty billion dollars towards the IRS. “... Even worse, we have been told by the President of the United States – he campaigned on a platform of ensuring taxes would not be increased ... We know that most of this eighty billion will be used to enhance the ability of the IRS to target middle Americans. That promise will be broken. Yet another. Nearly six months since ProPublica leaked private, legally protected taxpayer information, at a time when there is a peak level of distrust of the Internal Revenue Service, Democrats want to increase the power of the IRS to insinuate themselves into the private lives of ordinary Americans. “Now look, this is the wrong idea at the wrong time. We are in the middle of a pandemic. We have supply chain problems. We’re experiencing cost inflation across a range of consumer goods. We’ve got so many challenges, and once again the Biden Administration and Democrats in the United States Senate are out of touch with the real challenges and experiences of everyday Americans,” said Senator Young during the press conference. Two weeks ago, Senator Young joined Republican colleagues on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in sending a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to press the agency on its weak responses to the massive apparent leaks of private taxpayer information to ProPublica.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-braun-romney-blackburn-hagerty-inhofe-introduce-legislation-to-empower-state-innovation-within-medicaid-program,"WASHINGTON— Today, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) introduced the Let States Innovate Under Medicaid Act. This legislation authorizes a framework to allow innovation under Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration project waivers. Specifically, it would include “work or community engagement requirements” as an acceptable practice that furthers the objectives of the Medicaid program, thereby prohibiting the CMS administrator from denying a 1115 waiver on the basis that work or community engagement requirements do not further the objectives of the Medicaid program. “Medicaid should ideally be available as a temporary option, with a goal of preparing individuals for a life of dignity in the workforce. Work and community engagement activities, such as those that Indiana previously had in place, are designed to improve quality of life over the long term and help individuals transition to full employment. CMS’s decision earlier this year to revoke Indiana’s ability to set these expectations for some Medicaid recipients treats work as a punishment and discourages efforts to transition to self-reliance. That’s why I joined my colleagues to introduce the Let States Innovate Under Medicaid Act to allow states the opportunity to innovate under the Medicaid program, with the objective of preparing individuals for a life of independence in the workforce,” said Senator Young. In February 2021, at the direction of the Biden Administration, CMS began efforts to withdraw work requirement waiver authorities in several states that had either been previously approved, or had a pending application, to implement work requirements. CMS is continuing to review some states’ work requirement waivers, but has already withdrawn waiver authorities in nine states— Indiana, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin.  Additionally, other states have voluntarily withdrawn work requirements from their waiver applications or have postponed the implementation of work requirements because of the uncertainty concerning Medicaid work and community engagement programs. CMS based its decision to withdraw waiver authorities in the nine states on the basis that “work or community engagement requirements” do not further the objectives of the Medicaid program.  ###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-menendez-introduce-the-end-tuberculosis-now-act-of-2021,"WASHINGTON – U.S Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) today introduced the End Tuberculosis Now Act of 2021, comprehensive legislation to bolster U.S. efforts to combat the global TB pandemic. The bipartisan legislation, which for the first time addresses the major impact COVID-19 has had on global TB control efforts, directs the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to boost its bilateral tuberculosis programs and activities to account for new goals established by the international community. In 2018, the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UNHLM) set a new target of successfully treating 40 million people with Tuberculosis by 2022, including 3.5 million children. TB is now ranked as the second worst infectious killer in the world after COVID-19, with the World Health Organization estimating 1.9 million tuberculosis deaths in 2020 alone, underscoring the need to take urgent action.   “Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable, treatable, and curable disease. More than 25 years after it was declared a public health emergency, TB still remains the second most deadly infectious health threat next to COVID-19, and goes undiagnosed in many countries,” said Senator Young. “We must demonstrate U.S. leadership by passing our End Tuberculosis Now Act to find and treat TB, reduce the stigma, and better target this curable disease.” “I am proud to introduce the End Tuberculosis Now Act of 2021 to overhaul the United States’ response to the global tuberculosis pandemic to ensure this deadly and entirely preventable disease is placed at the forefront of our global health priorities,” said Senator Menendez. “As we begin to grasp the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic’s widening of gaps in global health equity, the spread of tuberculosis has intensified among vulnerable populations, with approximately one fourth of the world currently affected. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to secure passage of this critical legislation and to recommit the United States as a leader in the global fight to end the tuberculosis pandemic through improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.”  “As we rally against the newest pandemic, we can’t afford to ignore the longstanding ones. TB is a centuries old pandemic that killed 1.5 million people last year; we have the tools to end this curable disease, but we still need the resources and political attention to match,” said Joanne Carter, Executive Director of RESULTS. “RESULTS is grateful for the leadership of Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN) for introducing the End Tuberculosis Now Act of 2021 to help reach the millions of people with TB that health systems are leaving behind. We urge Congress to swiftly pass this bill and to greatly increase funding to fight TB everywhere in their end of year spending bill.” “As someone who lives and was treated for tuberculosis in New Jersey, I am so grateful for Senator Menendez and Senator Young's leadership on Global Health and their work to create a world without TB for families like mine,” said Kate O'Brien of We Are TB, current co-chair of the Tuberculosis Roundtable. “Tuberculosis is treatable and curable. That anyone dies of TB is a tragedy and an injustice. The End TB Now act will give tuberculosis programs across the globe the prioritization and oversight they require to ensure people are given the high-quality care they need and deserve. I am so thankful for this legislation and I hope these efforts to safeguard the health of millions of people is supported by others in Congress.""  ""Tuberculosis has long been one of the deadliest diseases in the world, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made our fight against TB more difficult and more urgent. We must act now to avert further unnecessary deaths and get us back on the path to ending TB once and for all. The End TB Now Act will bolster our efforts through a comprehensive approach to TB that allows more people to be diagnosed, improves access to the best available treatments, prevents future infections and disease, prioritizes the communities being placed at highest risk, builds partnerships for research and development, and so much more. We thank Sen. Menendez and Sen. Young for introducing this critically important legislation, and we look forward to a TB-free future that the End TB Now Act can help secure,"" said Elizabeth Lovinger, Treatment Action Group, co-Chair of Tuberculosis Roundtable. Find a copy of the full text of the legislation here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-gives-nightmare-before-christmas-speech-on-us-senate-floor,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) gave a speech on the U.S. Senate Floor today highlighting some of the “gifts” included in the Democrats’ Build Back Better Act that could cost American families this Christmas season.   “It seems that Democrats want our children and grandchildren to pay for this bundle of goodies through the lay-away plan. GDP is projected to fall because of Build Back Better. “Colleagues, the best present all of us can give the American people is to do whatever is in our power to stop the Build Back Better Act,” said Senator Young during his speech. Click here to view the Senator’s full speech.  See Below for the Senator’s Full Remarks as Prepared for Delivery: In case anyone was wondering, there are 16 shopping days left before Christmas. I know I still have some shopping to do myself, but it seems as though President Biden and my Democratic colleagues here in Congress have already done most of their shopping.That’s good thinking.  You can’t start too early with the supply chain as bad as it is. So let’s gather around the Christmas tree to see what gifts Democrats are prepared to pass out on Christmas morning thanks to their reckless tax-and-spend bill. To left-wing labor unions – Democrats are gifting billions of dollars in handouts to strengthen this core constituency of theirs. While they’re letting charitable tax deductions expire in Build Back Better, they have giftwrapped an above-the-line tax deduction for union dues. And as a special Christmas surprise, they’re putting under the tree a shiny new tax credit for electric vehicles – but only if those vehicles are made in a union shop. You see, if you are naughty and buy an electric vehicle from a non-union shop like those in my state of Indiana, you will miss out on the Democrats’ $4,500 holiday give-away in this bill. Apparently, during this Christmas season, the impact of EVs on climate change only matters if the workers’ contracts are collectively bargained. Which brings us to China, the tax hikes on businesses large and small in this bill will give China an unfair competitive advantage.  Increasing taxes on American businesses by more than $800 billion when they’re already struggling with supply-chain issues and worker shortages will do very little to bring the jobs of the future here.Which is exactly why the communist leaders in China will love this gift.And the largest gift under Washington Democrats’ tree goes to none other than the rich. By dramatically increasing the cap on the State and Local Tax deduction or SALT for short.The once-proud “party of the working class” is giving a tax cut to two-thirds of people earning more than $1 million a year. The average size of that cut is almost $17,000 a year for millionaires.This is the now Democratic Party. Merry Christmas. This is the single most expensive tax expenditure in the Build Back Better Act and it’s the second biggest component of the whole bill.Evidently, Democrats believe it’s better to give than receive from millionaires so they have proposed a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans from the wealthiest cities, gift wrapped from the Democratic Party.But maybe there’s something under the tree for the rest of us?After the handouts, giveaways, entitlements, and earmarks, what’s left for regular, middle class working stiffs?We know that the really big gifts come in the smallest packages...a lump of coal.That lump of coal represents a massive $367 billion that will be added to the debt by the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend bill according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Not to mention the ten years of tax increases included in the bill to pay for only a few years of policy changes.Of course, we all know that figure will be much higher in reality. If all the temporary provisions in this bill are made permanent – it will increase our budget deficit by nearly $3 trillion this decade.It seems that Democrats want our children and grandchildren to pay for this bundle of goodies through the lay-away plan.GDP is projected to fall because of Build Back Better. The cost of living is expected to rise even more than it already has over the last year because of BBB.And despite promises from President Biden & my Senate Democratic colleagues, if BBB were to become law, taxes would be raised on lower and middle class Americans who are just trying to get by.Ladies and gentlemen, this Christmas season, Democrats are not offering holiday jobs or good cheer.Instead, this feels more like the Nightmare Before Christmas. Colleagues, the best present all of us can give the American people is to do whatever is in our power to stop the Build Back Better Act.###"

This suspension created a disruption to the millions of new applicants and beneficiaries receiving Social Security benefits,” the senators wrote. “On behalf of the nearly 70 million Americans who receive benefits from SSA, we reiterate the need to reopen the field offices as quickly as possible. Our nation’s seniors and beneficiaries of SSA programs deserve no less.”  Nearly 21 months ago, the SSA suspended in-person services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the SSA reportedly submitted its reentry plan to the Office of Management and Budget in July of 2021, the SSA still has failed to fully reopen its offices to the public.

The Treaty is vitally important to U.S. foreign direct investment in Chile. Without ratification of the Treaty, Chilean tax rates are due to increase on U.S. companies’ Chilean operations and could reach a rate of 44.45 percent. By comparison, the Chilean operations of multinational companies headquartered in countries with treaties in force, such as China, Japan, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, would continue to enjoy the current Chilean rate of 35 percent.  Further, the Treaty would benefit U.S. companies, and a growing number of Chilean companies who operate in a variety of sectors, and are eager to increase their investments in the U.S. These investments have the potential to create thousands of jobs. Failure to ratify the treaty could significantly reduce investments by U.S. companies in Chile and weaken the U.S. economy. In order to strengthen the economy and protect U.S. company investments, we ask for your support to ensure the prompt ratification of the U.S.-Chile Tax Treaty.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-takes-action-to-address-supply-chain-crisis,"WASHINGTON – For years, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) has pushed for a bill to fix the truck driver shortage – one key component of the country’s supply chain. Now, as a supply chain crisis continues to hurt consumer and businesses this holiday season, that bill has become law and Senator Young is pushing even harder for more solutions.  “Everywhere I’ve gone in Indiana over the last few months, high prices and empty shelves have been chief concerns for Hoosiers,” said Senator Young. “The people sent me to Washington to solve problems, and Democrats should join Republicans in taking action to fix the supply chain instead of haggling over a massive tax-and-spend boondoggle that will only exacerbate our current crisis.” Among the list of Senator Young’s actions on the supply chain include: the DRIVE-Safe Act, the FREIGHT Act, and a supply chain mapping database. Senator Young’s DRIVE-Safe Act helps alleviate the nation’s truck driver shortage by allowing drivers aged 18-20 to cross state lines. The bill became law on November 15. Under previous law, drivers in this age group could drive within states, but could not cross state lines. These drivers must complete additional safety training in order to qualify. Additionally, Senator Young joined fellow Republican senators on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation to introduce the FREIGHT Act. This bill would take important steps to address the ongoing freight challenges while also putting in place policies to support the transportation network in the long term. Specifically, the FREIGHT Act would enhance appropriate government oversight of transportation operations, minimize barriers for stakeholders to address unlawful shipping conduct, streamline certification requirements for truck drivers, and incentivize the use of new technologies to improve efficiency. Finally, Senator Young successfully included an amendment in the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), also known as the Endless Frontier Act, that creates a voluntary online database to support supply chain mapping. This online toolkit will help American manufacturers divert supply chains from foreign countries back to the United States. The bill passed the Senate in June and is awaiting action in the House. In addition to legislative activity, Senator Young joined his Republican colleagues from the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in inviting the Biden Administration to testify before the committee on the steps they have taken to alleviate the crisis. “We have all seen the images of cargo vessels lined up for miles off the West Coast waiting to dock,” the senators wrote in the letter. “This committee would benefit from the opportunity to learn how your Administration is addressing the ongoing crisis and discuss potential solutions.” To read the full letter, click here.###"

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-prevent-settlement-payments-for-illegal-immigrants,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined his colleagues to introduce legislation to prevent payments for legal settlements for illegal immigration. Under the Protect American Taxpayer Dollars from Illegal Immigration Act, no federal funds, including money from the Judgment Fund, could be spent to enrich illegal immigrants at the expense of hardworking American taxpayers.  Despite the crisis consuming our southern border, President Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) wants to give out payments of $450,000 per person to illegal immigrants who broke our laws, came here illegally, and put their children’s lives at risk. If successful, President Biden’s DOJ could pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to illegal immigrants at the same time that hardworking American taxpayers are struggling under Democrat’s reckless tax and spend policies.  “Illegal immigrants are streaming across the border in record numbers. Everyone can see that the border is a clear and growing crisis, but the Biden-Harris Administration has no interest in fixing it,” said Senator Young.“Instead of discouraging illegal entry into the United States, if left unchecked, the Administration could hand illegal immigrants a winning lottery ticket with a $450,000 settlement. That’s why I joined my colleagues to put an end to these payouts and this growing crisis.” This legislation builds upon Senator Young’s prior leadership on this issue with the introduction of the Prohibiting Taxpayer Funded Settlements for Illegal Immigrants Act last month. Senators Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), James Risch (R-Idaho), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.

Nearly six months after ProPublica began disclosing confidential, private, and legally-protected taxpayer information, the IRS and the Biden Administration continue to show little regard for the haphazard handling of private taxpayer data.  ProPublica unabatedly continues to publish articles naming individual taxpayers while the IRS, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice have all failed to identify the source or sources of the leaked information.   “[…] ProPublica continues to publish what appears to be confidential taxpayer information that is protected by law, and as Commissioner, you have been a proponent of the IRS being allowed access to even more information from taxpayers and a significant and mandatory enforcement budget. The fact that the source of the information ProPublica continues to publish remains unknown means that the ability of the IRS to safeguard information already entrusted to it also remains unknown. It is possible that ProPublica obtained whatever information it has at one time from a specific source. However, if the ProPublica information was leaked or hacked from the IRS, and the IRS is unable to even determine if a leak or hack took place, this could indicate an ongoing and persistent problem with IRS information technology (IT) systems and the ability of the IRS to safeguard taxpayer information,” the senators wrote in the letter. The letter notes known deficiencies in IRS systems and highlights data and privacy security vulnerabilities involved in contractor relationships. The members also request further, detailed information about the IRS’s efforts to determine a source of the leaks, and what the IRS has done to resolve open recommendations for curing deficiencies. “As we enter month six with no information about how ProPublica obtained protected taxpayer information, the risks we highlighted in this letter are of growing concern,” the letter continues. “It is our constitutional obligation to ensure that IRS enforcement remains effective, and that requires the IRS to properly secure taxpayer information.”  To view the full letter, click here.### "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-youngs-fourth-annual-stomach-cancer-awareness-month-resolution,"WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the Senate passed U.S. Senator Todd Young’s (R-Ind.) bipartisan resolution marking November 2021 as Stomach Cancer Awareness Month. The annual resolution was first introduced in 2018 in memory of Indy Star reporter and columnist Matthew Tully, who lost his battle to stomach cancer that year.  The resolution was cosponsored by Senators Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and passed the Senate unanimously. Stomach cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and one of the most difficult to detect in its early stages. The resolution expresses support for more education of patients and health care providers and more research into early diagnosis, screening, and treatment. “This resolution was first introduced after the loss of Hoosier columnist Matthew Tully, and four years later, it is just as important to continue bringing awareness to this disease that has impacted so many Americans,” said Senator Young. “The goal is to bring awareness to stomach cancer so that we can detect and treat it sooner and save more lives.” The full text of the resolution can be found here. ###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/video-young-stands-for-life-ahead-of-tomorrows-supreme-court-hearing,"WASHINGTON–Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a press conference with his Senate GOP colleagues to discuss tomorrow’s scheduled oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organizationbefore the U.S. Supreme Court.  The landmark case concerns Mississippi’s state law protecting unborn babies from abortions after 15 weeks. Senator Young signed an amicus brief asking the Court to uphold this law and consider overturning the outdated precedents set by Roe v. Wade. “The United States of America is an outlier when it comes to how we protect babies. We are only one of seven countries around the world, one of seven countries, that allows abortion to take place past the point at which a baby can feel pain in the womb. We join the likes of the Chinese Communist Party and the dictator in North Korea in our policies. “Eighty percent of the American people oppose abortions beyond the point of which a child can feel pain. So, I look forward to welcoming other Hoosiers into this city tomorrow as they descend on the nation’s capital, make their voices heard, and ensure that the voices of those who can’t speak for themselves will ultimately be heard as well,” said Senator Young.  To hear the Senator’s full remarks, click here. "

The bill passed the House in October and now awaits President Biden’s signature. “America honors the bravery and selfless service of the 13 service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, including Indiana’s own Corporal Humberto ‘Bert’ Sanchez,” said Senator Young. “Bert gave his life protecting strangers thousands of miles from home. He was the best, not just of the Marine Corps, but of this country. It is fitting that we award these heroes the Congressional Gold Medal.”   Recipients of the commendation include Cpl. Humberto A.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-colleagues-to-urge-irs-to-investigate-enqs-pay-for-service-scheme,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.) today urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to investigate recent reports suggesting a private company is charging taxpayers a premium to speak to an IRS representative or face potentially hours-long wait times.  A company called EnQ, has allegedly been flooding the IRS with robo-calls and selling slots at the front of the hold line to paying customers, taking advantage of an already strained customer service system. EnQ charges premiums as high as $1,000 per year. “EnQ’s service creates a two-tiered system for taxpayers seeking to access assistance from the IRS. It also may exacerbate the poor response rates at the IRS it purports to address,” wrote the senators. “Being able to call the IRS is a free, public service that should be available on an equal basis. Paying to receive preferential access to the IRS should not be permitted,” concluded the senators. The IRS struggled to field incoming calls from taxpayers before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has worsened this issue.  Read the full letter here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-merkley-durbin-lead-senate-resolution-condemning-coup-in-burma-laying-out-coordinated-international-response-to-rohingya-genocide,"WASHINGTON –U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), today led a group of 13 senators in introducing a bipartisan resolution to condemn the military coup in Burma and subsequent violence against citizens calling for democracy, as well as the systematic campaign of persecution and atrocities against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities. The resolution calls for a genocide determination from the Department of State and lays out a plan for a coordinated, international response to the disturbing humanitarian crisis in Burma and neighboring states. The introduction comes amid escalating violence and instability in Burma following the overthrowing of the democratically elected government of Burma by the Burmese army—which has, least temporarily, returned the same army responsible for the genocidal persecution of the Rohingya people to a greater position of power and authority. “For more than three years, the Burmese military has engaged in a campaign of terror and oppression against the Rohingya people, forcing more than a million people to flee their homes. The time for accountability is now, and in light of the military’s recent coup, it is more urgent than ever that the United States label these actions for what they are: a genocide. This resolution urges President Biden to make such a determination, and reaffirms Congress’ commitment to seeking justice for the victims of the Burmese military’s violence,” said Senator Young. “I’ll never forget the painful stories I heard from members of the Rohingya community when I traveled to Burma and Bangladesh—stories of unspeakable violence and horrific crimes against humanity,” said Senator Merkley.“America can’t stay silent in the face of this genocide—and we must make it undeniably clear that when a government systematically persecutes its people and robs them of their basic human rights, there will be consequences. So let’s call together our partners of freedom around the world to use critical tools at our disposal to provide a pathway forward for the Rohingya people and put an end to this crisis.” The senators’ resolution would officially condemn the February 1, 2021 military coup; denounce the institutionalized and pervasive discrimination against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities in Burma, which has resulted in the genocide and forced displacement of 740,000 people; and urge Secretary of State Blinken to issue a formal determination designating those actions as genocide. In addition, the resolution calls on the Burmese authorities to allow journalists, human rights organizations, United Nations monitors, and humanitarian actors safe full access to every part of the country in order to ensure that humanitarian needs are being met and citizens, including ethnic minorities, are protected. The resolution would also address concerning recent reports that Rohingya refugees adrift at sea are being refused safe disembarkation or being moved into holding camps, and provide a framework for a coordinated international response to the genocide. That framework includes governments of neighboring countries providing immediate, direct cross-border assistance, and Bangladesh and other countries in the region providing safe harbor for those fleeing persecution from the Burmese military. The resolution would urge the Government of Bangladesh to grant the United Nations access to conduct independent assessments of conditions in Bhasan Char and verify that any relocation of Rohingya refugees to the island is voluntary and consensual, and call on international organizations, host governments, and donor nations to support improved access for Rohingya refugees to basic services, education, and livelihood opportunities. Young, Merkley, and Durbin were joined in today’s introduction by Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). The full text of the resolution is available here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-reintroduce-bipartisan-drive-safe-act,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) today reintroduced the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy (DRIVE-Safe) Act to address the driver shortage in the trucking and logistics industry, and enhance safety training and job opportunities for young truckers. U.S. Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Angus King (I-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) joined as original cosponsors of the bill. Though 49 states and the District of Columbia allow individuals to obtain a commercial driver’s license (CDL) at the age 18, federal law currently prohibits those operators from moving goods from state to state until they are 21. The DRIVE-Safe Act establishes an apprenticeship program that would allow for the legal operation of a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce by CDL holders under the age of 21. “Today, 18-year-olds can drive more than 200 miles from New Albany to Gary and back, but they aren’t allowed to drive two miles from New Albany to Louisville,” said Senator Young. “The DRIVE-Safe Act will eliminate this ridiculous regulation and in doing so address the driver shortage while providing new career opportunities for young Hoosiers.” “Now more than ever, young Montanans need more opportunities to get comprehensive job training, access higher paying work, and grow their careers early on,” said Senator Tester. “This bipartisan bill will do just that, allowing younger truck drivers to get top-of-the-line apprenticeships that kick their careers into gear, all while providing a big boost to the thousands of communities across the Big Sky who rely almost exclusively on trucks to move goods in and out of the state.” “Tens of thousands of commercial trucking jobs go unfilled each year across the United States. To make that problem worse, current regulations prevent younger drivers from participating in interstate trucking at all, denying them the opportunity for good-paying jobs. The DRIVE-Safe Act tackles both problems by allowing drivers under the age of 21 to pursue this career, as long as their employer adopts an apprenticeship program that includes rigorous training and safety standards,” said Senator Cotton. “Oklahoma is rightfully recognized as one of the nation’s leading transportation hubs with 11,000 trucking companies and over 27,000 truck drivers using over 12,000 miles of highways to access and fully utilize our three inland ports and nearly 4,000 miles of rail,” said Senator Inhofe. “I am glad to join Sen. Young in cosponsoring the DRIVE-Safe Act. With this legislation, we have the opportunity to address the truck driver shortage across industries such as oil and gas, agriculture and defense that drive Oklahoma’s economic growth, while improving transportation safety and giving younger Americans the ability to access skilled careers.” “The trucking and national supply chain network have been fundamental to America’s response to the coronavirus, moving goods to support medical personnel and sustain the public throughout this crisis,” said Senator King. “The industry is vital to our everyday life, but driver shortages threaten its future. The DRIVE Safe Act addresses these challenges by creating an apprenticeship program that works across state lines, enhances the skills of our workforce, and helps train the next generation of safe drivers. I’m proud to once again stand with my bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce this bill, and hope that the Congress will move on this commonsense solution to a pressing problem.” “Commercial drivers are the hard-working Americans who keep our nation running day in and day out, but tens of thousands of good-paying commercial driver jobs are left empty. Federal rules currently prevent commercial drivers under 21 from crossing state lines,” said Senator Manchin. “In West Virginia, that means someone can drive 5 hours from Beckley to Weirton, but can’t drive another 15 minutes over the river to Steubenville. We should be getting West Virginians into these jobs right out of high school, but many companies just don’t want to deal with the hassle. This bipartisan legislation will help fill that gap by establishing an apprenticeship training program for young Americans interested in these good-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us on this commonsense bill to put Americans back to work and fill vital roles in our economy.” “Kansas is the birthplace of the U.S. Interstate System and continues to provide a network of safe and reliable routes for interstate commerce and travel,” said Senator Moran. “As we saw during this pandemic, a shortage of truck drivers impacts our ability to move goods across roads and highways to support our economy, including transporting Kansas products. The DRIVE-Safe Act allows young CDL holders that meet rigorous safety standards and performance benchmarks to move goods from state to state, addressing the driver shortage while continuing to deliver commodities across Kansas and the country.”  The apprenticeship training program would help ensure these drivers are trained beyond current standards while instituting rigorous safety standards and performance benchmarks. The apprenticeship program established by the DRIVE-Safe Act would require young drivers to complete at least 400 hours of on-duty time and 240 hours of driving time with an experienced driver in the cab with them. All trucks used for training in the program must be equipped with safety technology including active braking collision mitigation systems, a video event capture system, and a speed governor set at 65 miles per hour or below. U.S. Representative Trey Hollingsworth (R-IN-09) introduced a companion bill in the House. “DRIVE-Safe creates more career opportunities for hard-working Hoosiers to get involved in a growing, 21st century economy workforce,” said Rep. Hollingsworth. “This bill also breaks down barriers for small businesses who want to grow and hire qualified employees.” Click here to view the bill text.###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-backs-vaccine-funding-and-stimulus-checks-rejects-non-covid-spending-in-relief-plan,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and 10 fellow Republican senators forced a vote on a targeted COVID relief plan, but ultimately voted against the bloated, partisan American Rescue Plan today.  “My Republican colleagues and I support providing additional assistance for needs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We support money for vaccines and personal protective equipment. We support re-opening schools. But we could not support a bloated and wasteful $1.9 trillion partisan bill, only 10 percent of which would go to COVID-related needs. We should not take advantage of a crisis to pass pet projects and unrelated policy wish lists,” said Senator Young. In the last year, Congress has passed five relief measures with broad bipartisan support, totaling nearly $3.5 trillion. Nearly $1.3 trillion of that money has not been spent. Senator Young outlined his opposition in an interview with Neil Cavuto and a speech on the Senate floor earlier this week. The $650 billion substitute amendment was proposed by Senator Young along with Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Members of this group met with President Biden last month to attempt to reach a compromise on COVID relief, but instead Democratic congressional leadership charged forward with a partisan plan. The amendment failed by a vote of 48-51. The Democrats’ bill ultimately passed by a party-line vote of 50-49. “The emergency we are facing should not be an excuse for funding partisan priorities. It’s unfortunate that the Administration and Democrats rejected this targeted, commonsense package that would have provided focused COVID-19 relief to the people who need it most,” the Senators said in a joint statement. The substitute amendment, which was built on the Group of 10’s COVID-19 relief plan that was unveiled last month, included the following provisions: HEALTHY FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES Direct COVID Pandemic Response. Provides nearly $160 billion to support vaccine distribution, expand testing, PPE, and to rebuild and restock the National Strategic Stockpile. This also includes $35 billion for the Provider Relief Fund to assist health care providers and hospitals, with an $8.5 billion set-aside for rural hospitals. Defense Production Act. Provides $5 billion for Title III of the Defense Production Act to help expand domestic production capacity of medical supplies and equipment.  Disaster Relief Fund. Provides $30 billion to replenish the Disaster Relief Fund, including $5 billion for PPE for first responders and health care providers, including small physician and dental practices. Nutrition. Provides $12.4 billion to nutrition assistance programs. This includes additional funding for the WIC Program, Pandemic EBT, and SNAP, including extending increased SNAP benefits through September 30, 2021. Behavioral Health Services. Provides $3.88 billion to strengthen activities related to mental health and substance abuse.  This includes $1.5 billion for the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and $1.5 billion for the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant.  IMMEDIATE AID TO INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES Unemployment. Extends federal unemployment programs through June and continues the $300 weekly supplement. Provides $2 billion to detect and prevent fraud, provide more equitable access, and ensure the timely payment of benefits, based on Young’s Unemployment Insurance Systems Modernization Act.  Economic Impact Payments. Provides an additional payment of $1,400 to adults in need and provides $500 for each of their dependents. These payments would go to single filers earning $40,000 or less with a complete phase out by $50,000; for joint filers earning $80,000 or less together with a complete phase out by $100,000; and heads of household earning $60,000 or less with a complete phase out by $75,000. Payments would not be made to undocumented immigrants or prisoners. Small Business. Provides $40 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program and extends the application deadline to June 30, 2021. Of this, $5 million is for audits and investigations. Also provides $10 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. SAFELY REOPENING SCHOOLS AND SUPPORTING CHILD CARE Schools. Provides $19 billion to reopen K-12 schools and to keep them open. Funding will be available to school districts that provide in-person instructions to at least half of their students at least half of the time. Funding will also be available for activities that support the safe reopening of schools. Also provides $1 billion to support non-public schools with COVID-related costs. Child Care. Provides $20 billion to the Child Care and Development Block Grant program to provide immediate assistance to child care providers and to support child care for families, including for healthcare workers and first responders. As part of the reconciliation bill’s rapid-fire vote-a-rama process, Young also sponsoredamendments to:  ###"

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-colleagues-in-bipartisan-bicameral-legislation-to-support-health-care-workers-mental-health-amid-covid-19,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) announced the reintroduction of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to reduce and prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among health care professionals. Health care professionals have long experienced high levels of stress and burnout, and throughout the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has only further exacerbated the problem. While helping their patients fight for their lives, many health care professionals have been coping with their own trauma of losing patients and colleagues and fear for their own health and safety. The bill will help promote mental and behavioral health among those working on the frontlines of the pandemic. It would also support training for health professionals to prevent suicide and burnout and increases awareness about suicide and mental health concerns among health care professionals. “Over the past year, our frontline workers bore the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic – putting their lives on the line every day so that our communities can stay safe and secure. As we continue to navigate this global health crisis, it is critical that we look out for Hoosier health care professionals and other frontline workers,” said Senator Young. ""The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act will help these workers get the support they need to prevent suicide and promote mental and behavioral health.”Senators Young and Kaine were joined in reintroducing the legislation by Senators Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-La.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), as well as U.S. Representatives Susan Wild (D-Pa.-07), David McKinley (R-W.Va.-01), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.-08), and Judy Chu (D-Calif.-27). The Senators are pushing for inclusion of the legislation in the latest COVID-19 relief package making its way through Congress. While the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act was formally introduced today on the Senate side, the legislation will formally be introduced on the House side next week.  “In my conversations with frontline health care workers over the past year, I’ve seen that this crisis is going to have a significant impact on the lives of health care professionals for a very long time,” said Senator Kaine. “As more people get vaccinated and we start to see the light at the end of the tunnel, the healers who’ve been caring for everyone else will continue to feel the effects of this trauma, yet face stigma in accessing treatment. It’s so important for Congress to pass this bipartisan legislation so we can meaningfully change how our health care industry approaches mental health and set up a more reliable infrastructure and culture for health care professionals to count on in the years to come.” ""Our health care heroes have long experienced high levels of stress and burnout, and COVID-19 has only exacerbated the problem. Not until the death of my beloved sister, did we learn of the pervasiveness of mental health issues among medical professionals,"" said Jennifer Breen Feist, co-founder of the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation. ""The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act legislation is a critical step in building the policy framework to address mental health concerns facing our healthcare providers during this challenging time. We are encouraged by the bipartisan support this legislation has garnered and hopeful that this important issue is at last generating the attention it deserves.” Specifically, the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act:The legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Angus King (I-Vt.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Mark R.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senate-passes-young-resolution-recognizing-february-as-career-and-technical-education-month,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) announced that yesterday the Senate unanimously passed a resolution recognizing February 2021 as Career and Technical Education (CTE) Month. The resolution was sponsored by the co-chairs of the Senate CTE Caucus, Senators Young, Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.). A broad, bipartisan group of 50 senators cosponsor the resolution. “In communities throughout Indiana, career and technical education (CTE) provides Hoosier students with hands-on experience and real world skills to better prepare them for jobs of the 21st century,” said Senator Young. “The pandemic has put a strain on the Hoosier workforce, so it is important that we raise awareness for the pivotal role CTE plays to addressing the skills gap and providing upward mobility for all Americans.” “Health care, shipbuilding, cyber security, energy—the fields CTE can prepare a student for are seemingly endless. CTE Month is a time to raise awareness about the opportunities CTE can provide and communicate the importance of investing in it,” said Senator Kaine. “Raising awareness to Career and Technical Education is key if we are going to continue to make progress toward ensuring that more Americans have the skills needed to match our growing workforce needs,"" said Senator Portman. “As co-chair of the Senate Career and Technical Education Caucus, I believe that we have a duty to make 21st century skills training more accessible and affordable. I will continue my work at the federal level to make sure that Washington is an effective partner with local communities in providing Americans with the skills training they need to succeed.""   “I’m proud to join this bipartisan effort to highlight the importance of career and technical education.  The only way we can meet workforce readiness challenges effectively, is if we have strong public-private partnerships that are supported by a Congress working across party lines. We are showing that commitment with this Senate Resolution,” said Senator Baldwin. “We know that CTE is one of the most effective vehicles for responding to labor market changes and the workforce readiness needs of business. Now we need to do more to support CTE students so that they are better equipped for the high-skilled jobs of today and tomorrow.” Senator Young supported advancement of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, which became law in 2018 and included a number of provisions championed by the CTE Caucus to improve quality and access for CTE programs across the country. Last Congress, Senators Young and Kaine introduced the ACCESS to CAREERS Act, to provide resources to states and community colleges in order to address the evolving demands of the labor market through boosting student success and career readiness. Last July, the senators also sent a letter to Senate leadership expressing support for including the legislation in pandemic relief legislation.  Full text of the resolution is available here.   ###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-bennet-scott-reintroduce-the-finish-act-to-promote-innovation-in-higher-education,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announced reintroduction of the Fund for Innovation and Success in Higher Education (FINISH) Act to spur innovation in the higher education system. The bipartisan legislation supports the use of evidence-based innovation grants and the pay for outcomes model to benefit students. “Even before the pandemic, our higher education system was already falling short in serving our vulnerable students. In fact, every year, 1.2 million low-income or first-generation students enroll in college, but only a quarter of them will leave with a job related to their studies or enter graduate school. As our economy continues to struggle, we must be cognizant of student debt. It’s more important than ever to incentivize innovation through evidence-based solutions and set students up for success,” said Senator Young. “The FINISH Act works to ensure our students have the tools to finish a credential or degree pathway – not just start – by using incentives to adopt innovative solutions.” “An effective higher education system is critical to the long-term success of our students and our economy. Too often, high-need students, such as first-generation students and students from low income backgrounds, are underserved and under supported by our colleges and universities. The FINISH Act will promote innovation, flexibility, and evaluation in higher education to help improve educational attainment and outcomes for all students,” said Senator Bennet. “Every student learns differently, and to constrain them to a single cookie-cutter path of education is detrimental for their studies and our nation’s future. We need to innovate and diversify higher education as it becomes increasingly evident that the workforce of the future is dependent on a wide array of skills, knowledge, and experience,” said Senator Scott. “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing the FINISH Act that will authorize innovation grants, encourage open-educational resources, and enforce greater accountability of tax-payer dollars in higher education.”  The FINISH Act would authorize innovation grants, encourage open-educational resources, and establish better evaluation authority. The bill also works to support efficient and innovative uses of taxpayer funds through Pay-for-Outcomes initiatives.  The FINISH Act again received widespread support from 118 local, state, and national organizations in a recent letter including Results for America, Knowledge Alliance, and Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP). In the letter, the organizations commended the senators for introducing the FINISH Act, “which would leverage the power of evidence and innovation to improve outcomes in higher education.” To read the full letter, click here. The legislation would: Click here to view full bill text.###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-baldwin-peters-reintroduce-bipartisan-great-lakes-winter-commerce-act,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) are reintroducing the Great Lakes Winter Commerce Act, bipartisan legislation that will codify the U.S. Coast Guard’s icebreaking mission on the Great Lakes and increase the icebreaking capacity of the Great Lakes fleet. Icebreaking is critical for commerce in the Great Lakes, and increasing icebreaking capacity will help the many businesses and workers that rely on the maritime industry to transport their goods to market and grow our regional economy. “Hoosier businesses and workers rely on the Great Lakes to transport goods and services, but commerce can be impeded without icebreaking to clear the pathway during cold weather months,” said Senator Young.“Roughly 28 percent of our nation’s annual economic output comes from the Great Lakes region, and the pandemic has only emphasized the area’s importance to our nation’s economy. Our legislation will support icebreaking missions to expand capacity to ship goods, create jobs, and strengthen the economy in Indiana and other Great Lake states.” “Inadequate icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes is costing us thousands of American jobs and millions in business revenue. We must boost our icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes to keep our maritime commerce moving,” said Senator Baldwin. “I’m proud to partner with Senators Young and Peters on this bipartisan effort that will move our region closer to getting the sufficient icebreaking resources needed to support our maritime industry, mitigate devastating climate-related events and protect our Great Lakes for generations to come. I will keep working with my colleagues to get this job done for Wisconsin businesses and workers.” “Icebreaking in the Great Lakes is critical not just for Michigan’s economy – but for our entire country. As we have seen this winter, the economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic has made the importance of icebreaking more vital than ever to our small business community,” said Senator Peters. “I’m pleased to join my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to prioritize icebreaking in the Great Lakes and ensure safe trade and commerce.” Icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes supports more than 90 million tons of cargo annually. A study commissioned by the Lake Carriers’ Association found that during the 2018-2019 ice-season, businesses that depend upon the Great Lakes maritime industry lost over $1 billion in revenues because of delays caused by inadequate icebreaking. These economic losses resulted in the loss of over 5,000 jobs throughout the Great Lakes region. The bipartisan bill would update the outdated U.S. Coast Guard’s (USCG) Great Lakes icebreaking mission and increase the icebreaking capacity of the Great Lakes fleet.  Specifically, the legislation: “This historic bill will codify into law a long time Coast Guard mission that protects national and economic security. It provides Congressional direction and performance metrics. Currently, the Coast Guard interprets the 'reasonable demands of commerce' as meaning that an ice covered waterway is open until a second vessel is stuck in the ice for more than twenty-four hours as a result of another vessel’s inability to move. They only report to Congress ice restrictions in four connecting channels for the entire Great Lakes,” said Jim Weakley, President of the Lake Carriers’ Association. “For too many years, inadequate icebreaking has unnecessarily risked the lives of sailors. Ships have been forced into collisions and groundings or have been sliced open by ice because no Coast Guard icebreakers were available to assist. The bill respects those risking their lives to keep our economy moving during the winter,” said John Clemons, President of the Great Lakes Maritime Task force and American Maritime Officers Union National Vice President, Great Lakes. “This has been a priority for the Great Lake Maritime Task Force for a decade and we welcome the bill’s introduction. Just like we plow our roads, we need to keep traffic moving on our maritime highways,” said Richard Hammer, Vice President of the Great Lakes Maritime Task Force and General Manager of Donjon Shipbuilding. “This bill supports jobs across the Great Lakes and the nation. It comes at a critical time as ports continue to move cargo vital to the economic recovery. Now, more than ever, predictable and dependable icebreaking is needed to ensure cargo can continue to move efficiently. It would be devastating to have another winter like 2019 when the economy lost $1 Billion and more than 5,000 jobs due to inadequate icebreaking,” said Steve Fisher, Executive Director of the American Great Lakes Ports Association. Organizations endorsing the Great Lakes Winter Commerce Act include the Lake Carriers’ Association (Ohio), Great Lakes Maritime Task Force, American Great Lakes Ports Association, American Maritime Congress, American Maritime Officers, American Maritime Officers Service, American Steamship (New York), Andrie (Michigan), ArcelorMittal USA (Indiana/Ohio), Carmeuse (Pennsylvania/Michigan), Central Marine Logistics (Indiana), Cleveland-Cliffs (Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota), Consumer Energy Alliance (Ohio), Detroit Wayne County Port Authority (Michigan), Donjon Marine (Pennsylvania), Duluth Seaway Port Authority (Minnesota), Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding & Marine Group (Wisconsin), Fraser Shipyards (Wisconsin), Grand River Navigation (Michigan), Great Lakes Fleet (Minnesota), Great Lakes Shipyard (Ohio), Great Lakes Towing Company, Inland Lakes Management (Michigan), Interlake Steamship (Ohio), International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers Lodge 60 (Michigan), International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, International Longshoremen’s Association, International Shipmasters Association, Key Lakes Shipping (Pennsylvania), Kokosing Industrial (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana), LafargeHolcim (Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio), Lake Erie Coal and Ore Dock Council (Ohio), Lake Michigan Carferry Service (Michigan, Wisconsin), Lakes Pilots Association (Michigan, Ohio), Lorain Port Authority (Ohio), Lower Lakes Towing (Ontario), Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, Masters Mates and Pilots Union, MCM Dredging (Michigan), Michigan Maritime Trades Port Council, Pere Marquette Shipping Company (Michigan), Port City Marine Services (Michigan), Port of Cheboygan (Michigan), Port of Cleveland (Ohio), Ryba Marine (Michian), Seafarers International Union, Soo Marine Supply (Michigan), The American Waterways Operators (AWO), Transportation Institute, VanEnkevort Tug and Barge (Michigan, Ohio) and the Western Great Lakes Pilots Association (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan). The full bill text is available here."
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-kaine-introduce-bill-to-repeal-1991-and-2002-aumfs,"WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) reintroduced their bipartisan legislation to repeal the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq. The bill would formally end the authorizations for the Gulf and Iraq wars – 30 and 19 years, respectively, after these AUMFs were first passed, reasserting Congress’ vital role in not only declaring wars, but in ending them. The repeal of these authorizations also recognizes the strong partnership the United States now has with a sovereign, democratic Iraq. The bill is also cosponsored by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “It has been thirty years since the first Gulf War began and nineteen years since the United States went back into Iraq. In the years since, Congress has been operating on autopilot when it comes to our essential duties to authorize the use of military force. The fact that authorities for both of these wars are still law today is illustrative of the bipartisan failure of Congress to perform its constitutionally-mandated oversight role,” said Senator Young. “Today, Senator Tim Kaine and I have re-introduced our bipartisan legislation to continue our fight to repeal these outdated war authorities. Congress must not shy away from this debate and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to advance this important legislation.” “Last week’s airstrikes in Syria show that the Executive Branch, regardless of party, will continue to stretch its war powers,” said Senator Kaine. “Congress has a responsibility to not only vote to authorize new military action, but to repeal old authorizations that are no longer necessary. The 1991 and 2002 AUMFs that underpinned the war against Iraq need to be taken off the books to prevent their future misuse. They serve no operational purpose, keep us on permanent war footing, and undermine the sovereignty of Iraq, a close partner. I call on Congress to promptly take up this measure and for the Biden Administration to support it to finally show the American people that the Article I and II branches can work together on these issues.” This bill is an effort to prevent the future misuse of the expired Gulf and Iraq War authorizations and strengthen Congressional oversight over war powers. For years, Young and Kaine have been leading voices in Congress raising concerns over the use of military force without congressional authorization. Repealing these authorities will not impact ongoing U.S. operations to counter ISIS. For the full bill text, click here. "
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-young-highlights-wasteful-spending-in-partisan-covid-relief-bill,"WASHINGTON –  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) laid out his opposition to Democrats’ American Rescue Plan due to hundreds of billions of dollars in wasteful pet projects and spending unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News and again in a speech on the Senate floor, Senator Young pointed to blue state bailouts, a Silicon Valley subway, and Paycheck Protection Plan loans for Planned Parenthood as reasons for his opposition.  Senator Young was one of 10 Republican Senators who met with President Biden on February 1 to present a more targeted COVID relief proposal and has been outspoken on the need for the next COVID-19 relief package to be bipartisan. “What we should not do in the United States Senate is pass this so-called American Rescue Plan – $1.9 trillion which 90% of which has nothing to do with health related expenditures. In fact, we need to focus on just a few things. We have got to get our kids back to school, we have to get people back to work, and on top of all of that we have to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible,” said Senator Young in the interview. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Young’s interview.   Later that day, Senator Young reiterated his concerns on the Senate floor highlighting the bill’s price tag and other unrelated provisions that are contained in this package. “There is no doubt that some Hoosiers and many Americans are still hurting. We can and we will and we must help those people. But President Biden and the national Democrats’ so-called American Rescue Plan is not the way to do it… We are not going to just let national Democrats cram unrelated policies into what should be a bill squarely targeted at the crisis. We need a bill just like the five bills that we passed in a strongly bipartisan fashion just last year,” said Senator Young on the Senate floor. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Young’s floor speech.

https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-coons-resolution-establishing-national-ffa-week-passes-senate-,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) introduced a bipartisan resolution that established February 20-27, 2021 as National FFA Week to recognize the important role of the FFA in communities across America. U.S. Representatives Tracey Mann (R-Kan.) and Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) led an identical resolution in the House of Representatives that was introduced last Tuesday, February 23rd. The resolutions received broad bipartisan support, with 49 cosponsors in the Senate and 77 in the House of Representatives. Yesterday, the resolution passed the Senate with unanimous support. In addition to designating National FFA Week, the resolution recognizes the important role of the National FFA Organization in developing young leaders and providing educational and career opportunities to students, and celebrates over 50 years of FFA alumni and supporters. “For communities across Indiana, the FFA plays a critical role in the development of students through agricultural education. The lessons, tools, and resources gained throughout the program equip Indiana’s future leaders with the lifelong skills needed to succeed,” said Senator Young. “I am pleased to have introduced this resolution establishing National FFA Week to support the more than 12,000 FFA members in Indiana.” “The National FFA Organization and Delaware FFA play critical roles in strengthening our communities and preparing the next generation of leaders to meet the many challenges facing American agriculture,” said Senator Coons. “I am proud to join Senator Young in leading this bipartisan resolution celebrating National FFA Week and recognizing FFA’s alumni and supporters.” “On behalf of the 760,113 National FFA members across the United States, I’d like to thank US Senators Todd Young and Chris Coons for their support of our organization by their lead authorship of the Senate Resolution commemorating National FFA Week. This year marks a special milestone for National FFA as we celebrate 50 years of the Alumni and Supporters Program. Our organization estimates that there are over 8 million FFA alumni worldwide. As FFA works to grow the next generation of leaders in agriculture through school-based agricultural education, we greatly appreciate the support of Senator Young and his colleagues in the US Senate,” said Doster Harper, National FFA President. View the full text of the resolution here.  ###"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-group-of-senators-call-on-houthis-to-halt-their-marib-offensive,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) were joined by Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) on Friday to issue a bipartisan call for the Houthis to halt their offensive on Marib: “In 2018, the international community called on the Saudi-led coalition to halt plans to attack the city of Hudaydah due to the massive humanitarian implications. Thankfully, those calls were heeded and we avoided a mass starvation event in Yemen. Today it is the Houthis who risk unleashing a new humanitarian catastrophe on the 3 million people of Marib, the overwhelming majority of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have sought shelter in the city or nearby camps,” the senators wrote. “We call on the leaders of the Houthis and their supporters in the Iranian government to stop the offensive on Marib and avoid the needless death and destruction that would come from a protracted battle. We urge all parties to agree to a nationwide ceasefire and begin inclusive political negotiations to end the war.”"
https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-joins-bill-to-require-congressional-vote-before-any-iran-sanctions-relief-is-granted,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) introduced the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2021, a bill that would enable Congress to approve—or block—any Administration effort to suspend or terminate U.S. sanctions against the Iranian regime.  “The removal of sanctions against Iran without substantial, verifiable commitments by the regime to halt its nuclear enrichment program, as well as its support for terrorist proxies and its ballistic missile program, would simply be rewarding bad behavior. This bill is essential to avoid repeating mistakes of the past by ensuring that Congress is involved. The United States must signal to our allies and partners in the region that we are firmly opposed to the Iranian regime’s malign activities and that we intend to negotiate from a position of strength,” said Senator Young.“It is critical that Congress proactively serve as a check on the Biden Administration’s irresponsible and dangerous appeasement efforts, especially as Iran’s terror-sponsoring regime continues to back aggression against Americans abroad. The United States cannot fall victim again to Tehran’s blackmail, bribery, and extortion by giving into its demands for sanctions relief. My legislation will ensure that Congress will have its say before the Biden Administration takes actions that jeopardize the security of the United States, Israel, and our Arab partners in the Middle East,” said Senator Hagerty.Even as the Iranian regime continues to support terrorism, regional militancy, missile proliferation, cyber attacks, and other forms of aggression—including rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias targeting U.S. forces in Iraq—the Biden Administration last week indicated that it wants to negotiate with Tehran to relieve sanctions on the Iranian regime and reenter the flawed nuclear deal. This legislation builds on the precedent of a 2017 bipartisan law, supported by Senator Young, that empowers Congress to vote to support or block Russian sanctions relief, and applies identical congressional review procedure to any future Iran sanctions relief. In effect, the bill would prevent the Administration from rolling back sanctions in exchange for advancing negotiations or reentering the deal without first securing strong congressional support.The bill is supported by 20 original co-sponsors, including Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Shelly Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John Kennedy (R-La.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.)."
